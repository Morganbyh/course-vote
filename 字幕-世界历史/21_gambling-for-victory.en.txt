Hi.
Welcome back. This presentation's going to focus on
strategies in a total war. But before I get into the presentation, I
just want to offer a side observation about my approach
to this class. These slides, my discussions, may
sometimes seem a little bit drained of the color, human
drama, agony and tragedy of all these thing that
are going on, all these broken and horribly interrupted lives. That's not because I don't care about
those things, in fact, don't find them extremely
interesting. There are books, movies, other things that
can enlighten you a lot about those, and occasionally we use photographs or
other images to give you a glimpse of it. The comparative advantage of what I'm
doing in these lectures and what's going on in these slides is to be
analytical about it. It's easy just to do storytelling. The hard part is to piece through all the
facts, all the things that are happening and try to identify why did
things turn out the way they did. Display the structure of that thought so
that you can engage with it. First thing, let's talk about a couple of
critical gambles that are being made at the end of 1941, as the war
escalates into a global conflict. Japan attacks the United States. America is in the war, but the United
States had prodded Japan, hoping that Japan would not attack the United States.
Remember the American grand strategy that they had fixed on by the end of 1940 was
Germany First. Germany First doesn't mean, hey, let's get
to war with Japan. So what happened? Well the Americans made some calculations
as to how they were going to get their strategy
to work. They hope to deter Japan from attacking. Well if you think about their
calculations, some things went right. If you remember, we talked about the Americans put sanctions on Japan
constraining their access to oil and some vital
resources. Why? In part, because they wanted to keep the
Japanese from attacking the Soviet Union. And that calculation was right, they did
keep the Japanese [LAUGH] from attacking the Soviet
Union -- at some cost. There are some other things that went
right. They wanted the Japanese to notice the
Americans as a critical adversary whom they could not
ignore. That they didn't, they wanted the Japanese
not to think, oh you can bypass the Philippines, you don't have to
have a war with America, you can invade all these other possessions of the British, the French, the Dutch, and
control all of the Southeast Asia and you don't
have to reckon with the Americans. The Americans asserted themselves in a way
that communicated to the Japanese: You gotta
deal with us. They thought the Japanese would conclude
from that, don't do it. Instead the Japanese looked at their
choices and said, let's take a chance and do it, since we can't get the Americans to
settle on terms we like. So, obviously, some things went wrong with
the American calculations. What went wrong? They underestimated the way the Japanese
would work through this problem. Maybe they underestimated the fatalism of
the Japanese leadership, faced with extreme choices neither of
which they liked. Even towards the end when they saw that we
need to maybe work something out to defer this, there was some sense in which they never really quite put it all
together. It's very interesting when they are
arguing about the modus vivendi idea that I talked about
last time, one of the people in favor of the modus vivendi is the head of the Army, General
Marshall, because he doesn't want a war with Japan
at the end of 1941. America is coming very close already to getting into a war with Germany in struggles over American shipping to
Britain in the Atlantic and the German U-boat danger. It's already
very close to war with Germany. He doesn't want a war with Japan, at least
not then. But for a variety of considerations, the
Americans didn't make the deal for fear of offending allies, but it's not clear when, when they decided not to go along with the modus
vivendi, that they really put it all together and realized,
oh my God, we might find ourselves in war with the wrong enemy at the wrong time. This is another way of visualizing what
went wrong. So now, has American strategy failed?
They now find themselves involved in a war, but are forced now to deal with Japan first, and have to put Germany
aside. No, the Americans are rescued from this
strategic mistake. They're rescued from their strategic
mistake by a couple of things. First, the Germans declared war on them. Now the Germans did that because they
promised the Japanese they would do it, as they were egging the Japanese to
attack and preoccupy the Americans. But that turns out to be important. Another reason the Americans were able to
avoid the strategic dilemma is the Japanese are incredibly victorious, more
victorious than the Americans had thought they would be, but they don't push the Americans to the
extreme point that the Americans have to abandon the effort against Germany and concentrate everything
on Japan. We'll come back to the key moment where
that issue was in play in the middle of 1942. Alright, Gamble #2. This was not an
American gamble, this was a Japanese gamble, partly a
German gamble, too. Their side gambled, in their grand strategy
of 1941, that they could rapidly defeat the
Soviet Union. That's why they could afford to go ahead
and have a war with the United States. So what went wrong with that gamble? That gets into the German campaign on the
Eastern Front, the most colossal and intense
ground war probably ever fought in modern history, maybe ever fought in
history at all, an extraordinary conflict. It's often portrayed in maps like this one
that just show a lot of arrows moving. It's just worth kind of a stopping and
making a digression here. What do we mean when we see these arrows
on a map? Millions of people moving. It's just useful to visualize what the
movement of a modern industrial army is like for just
a second. I'm here at the University of Virginia. We have, at our university, about 12,000
undergraduate students. Let's just suppose for a minute that I
took all 12,000 of those undergraduate students and said,
you're now an army division. That's actually about the right size for a division, and all 12,000 of those
students now have to arm themselves and go on a gigantic camping trip, marching
two, three, four hundred miles someplace. If any of you have been on a camping trip,
an overnight camping trip, let's say for two, three, maybe a camping trip for four
days, you know a little bit about what that's
like. Now imagine you're going on that camping trip for weeks, for months
on end. And you're taking all your stuff with you
and then behind you there are people who are providing you, and the hundreds of machines that are accompanying you
marching over land, with all the food you're going to
need to eat, all the fuel you're vehicles are going to consume, all the ammunition
you and the vehicles are going to need, plus the facilities to fix, to take care of the people that get
hurt or sick, and the facilities to take care of the vehicles
that get broken all along the way. Now think about just the scale of that
effort and the ordeal of it. For the human beings a lot, as you would know if you'd been on a multi-day camping
trip, a lot of the ordeal is, after a while is just you're tired, you're exhausted, you
don't get much sleep. You think all the time about hot food, shelter, getting out of the rain for
example. There's no, no particular way you get out
of the rain, unless you have shelter. Day in, day out. Plus, occasionally, people are trying to
kill you. So, on top of that just, kind of, ordeal,
then there's the challenge of just keeping up
with all the supplies. We're talking hundreds of tons of supplies
every day. Where are the supplies coming from, if
you're off road? Maybe you bring them up on a railroad,
then they have to be disembarked from the
railroad cars. They have to be put on wagons or trucks, pulled either by horses, the
German army in 1941 used millions of horses.
Horses, trucks, and so on to try to get them and then as far as they can
just has to be hauled overland by people. So visualize the enormity of this effort, then add to that the conditions of
industrial warfare, which on this scale has now
disappeared from modern life and may never I hope recur again. Industrial warfare like this occurs with
people standing up and walking someplace or running, and then they have
machines that are carrying people. When you stand up and walk, people try to
shoot you or they drop high explosives in the vicinity that
sends shards of metal in every direction. Whenever that happens, the first instinct
of anyone is to try to drop to the ground and indeed get into
the ground if they can, because anything above
the ground is likely to be shredded by these random
pieces of metal or shards of woods from splintered trees
and the like. If you're in an armored vehicle, you might
think you're safe, except a nine or ten foot
armored vehicle can be seen from a mile away, and
anything you can see you can try to kill. And then that armored vehicle can't shrink
down and get into the ground, it has nowhere to
hide. So the other people have something that
can kill one of those vehicles, all the people in it would be blown to
pieces or burned alive. So that's why sometimes infantrymen were
not envious of the people inside the tanks. So you're marching along on this gigantic camping trip with people occasionally
dropping high explosives on you, with constant disruptions, and
this is going on and on, month after month. Now, that's a little bit of the human
reality that we're thinking about when we see these
arrows on a map. What the Germans are doing is they're
making extraordinary headway against a Red Army
that was surprised by the attack, out-maneuvered and takes
terrific blows in the early months of the German
offensive. But the Germans cannot knock out the
Soviet army. They're fighting too hard. The job was simply too big for them. Their estimates of how they could complete it rapidly and keep their armies supplied
were rash and over confident. The Germans, what the Germans then do, Interestingly, is they push really beyond
their limits. Looking at this map again, by the fall of
1941, let's say by October 1941, the Germans are roughly in
a line something like around here. The odds that they were going to succeed
in knocking out the Soviet Union were not
very good. Rather than settle into strong defensive positions, let their supplies catch up,
and then let the Soviets come at and batter them, instead, and somewhat
characteristically, Hitler and his generals, but especially his generals, want just one more
desperate, really almost desperate final effort to
somehow win it all by capturing Moscow. They get pretty close as you can see here,
but what happens is, as winter is setting in at the
beginning of December 1941, you have soldiers who
aren't dug in, aren't well supplied, they're scattered all over the
countryside, exhausted in an effort, a failed effort, to try to win. They are at their most vulnerable to a counterattack, which is exactly what
happens to them on December 5th, 1941, when the Red Army uses its remaining reserves, and hits
the Germans very hard, knocking them back. So their position actually ends being, by
early ï¿½42, even worse than it would have been if they had just
dug in. So the Germans, desperate to somehow win
the war in 1941, not content to just ride it into
1942 and build up their strength, try to win it all and make their situation, in a way,
even worse. The third big gamble that goes on in the
grand strategies of the Axis powers at the end of 1941, both the Germans and the Japanese, is that they can pin the
Americans down in the Pacific, and American military
power won't make a huge difference in the rest of the world. That
gamble fails, too. But it was a close call. The Japanese victory at Pearl Harbor is
substantial, but it's incomplete. It's incomplete for two reasons.
First, the American aircraft carriers weren't in the
Harbor. They were out at sea. People are just beginning to realize as
this war starts, that aircraft carriers are the trump cards of
naval warfare during the 1940s, and the few American aircraft carriers,
there are only three or four of them available in the whole Pacific at
that point, they're not in Pearl Harbor. They sink battleships, not aircraft
carriers. The other thing that the Japanese failed
to do, and this was a very revealing mistake, is they don't get the oil, and let me
explain what I mean by that. It's important to understand where Hawaii
and Pearl Harbor is on a map. Here it is. You see it is kind of midway, between, the
American West Coast and all these key areas out here in the
Western Pacific, including Japan itself. For the Americans to supply their ships
that want to fight in the Pacific, they can't carry all their oil with them from
California, or at least it's, it's really hard to do. So what they do is they use Hawaii as, in
a way, a giant fueling station. This enormous gas station, if you will,
except of course, it's filled with all kinds of oil and other sorts of
naval stores, but on a vast scale, whole tank farms. The
Japanese don't attack any of that because, in a way very old fashioned,
they're thinking destroy the battleships. But actually, if they had destroyed all
those oil tanks with all that oil, the ability of the
Americans to operate their navy in this part of the
Pacific Ocean would have been crippled until they could
laboriously rebuild and refill all those vital supplies from California
out to Hawaii. Hawaii is absolutely critical as a
strategic base for everything the Americans can do in projecting power
in the Pacific. If it seems like sometimes I dive into some detail about these battles or
campaigns, I don't do it very often, but where I do it, it's because I think these are choices
that actually change pathways in the whole history of
the world. And therefore, the same way we might delve
into details about the invention of electricity, it's
worth going into similar details about matters seemingly as
technical as what the Japanese chose to destroy in their attack of
December 7, 1941. Put yourself in the Japanese position.
They win a series of extraordinary victories in the first months of 1942. But then their big strategic challenge is:
What do we do next? And I break it down here as three basic
directions. Which way do you want to go now?
To help you visualize Japan's big choices, think about the Japanese situation as of
say, oh, March 1942. By that time, the Japanese effectively
control an area something like this, from that area they can do up to
three different things. One, big attack to take out Hawaii and
invade and occupy Hawaii, effectively driving the Americans back to
California as the place from which they'll have to start any
campaign against Japan. Option two, Australia, go south, knock
that out as a potential land base from which the Americans would have to mount
operations that would climb back up the island chain. Option three, raid around the Indian
Ocean, threaten the British position in India, help expand to the west
out of Burma and into India itself. Or, frankly the Japanese could have had
the option of helping the Germans knock out the Soviet Union by
attacking the Soviets up there. Of all those options, what the Japanese do
is they don't choose this, cause they think the Germans have that problem under control, and they're
preoccupied. And then looking at these three options,
they kind of decide, in a bureaucratic compromise, to
do all three. They launch a big carrier raid in the Indian Ocean. They launch moves to try to prepare for
possible attacks on Australia, down here. And then they also work up an operation
that first will invade and occupy Midway Island here,
preparatory to the attack on Hawaii. But by trying to do all three of these things, they end up doing none of them
adequately. The key was the battle at Midway, because at least in my opinion,
the most important strategic objective for the Japanese was
to disable their main enemy. That was the United States. And the best way to disable the United
States in 1942 was to deprive the Americans of
control of Hawaii. So the Midway operation should have been
key. And the Midway operation was defeated in
an incredibly close call. The Japanese had a plan in which they were
going to make a faint, here, towards the Aleutian Islands,
hope the American forces would go up there to respond to it, and then they
would have their invasion forces come up to Midway,
protected by a powerful carrier force. And then if the Americans caught on,
belatedly, perhaps, to what was going on, they'd have a decisive naval battle out here in which they'd destroy the American
carriers. The Americans, in an incredible intelligence
coup, can read the Japanese naval traffic. They know what the plan's going to be
before it happens. They're not taken in by the Aleutians
move, they get ready for this. Even so, and even exhausted from their
other efforts, the Japanese still have four carriers that
they can deploy against three by the Americans, and
it becomes a battle of who will find the other first, who will be able to strike effectively first, and, in just the fortunes of war, the
Americans get the lucky break: They win the battle
of Midway; they lose only one of their carriers; they
destroy all the Japanese carriers. And that turns out
to be key. Why is that so important? Because if the Japanese win this battle
and can move on to control to Hawaii, the Americans
would have felt that they were being driven back to
California itself at that point. It's very hard to imagine that at that
point, the Americans don't switch to a strategy of Japan First and suspend the
bulk of their operations against Germany. So, as a result of the victory at the
battle of Midway, the Americans can afford to still have a grand
strategy of putting Germany First. So at this point in the story, into 1942, you can see that a lot
of the big gambles to try to get a complete global victory
have failed, gambles on several sides, and the result of those
gambles failing is that by 1942 the major powers are now all locked in a
global total war. The fate of that war, and which strategies for victory
in that kind of war are going to pay off, is going to be our
subject for next time. See you then.
