Welcome back. I'm going to start this week by focusing
on a period of only about a year and a half in this
presentation, between about June 1940 and the end of
1941. This is a period in which the Second World
War is transformed. Think about it. Beginning of this period, you've got two
regional wars. There is a war going on in Europe, the
dictators are winning. There is a war going on in East Asia. Actually, that one started in 1937, with
the Japanese all-out assault on China. The dictators are winning there, though
it's not over yet. So, two big regional wars going on. In this year and a half, between the
middle of 1940 and the end of ï¿½41, these two wars will merge, the United
States and the Soviet Union, both of which were
not in the war, are fully in it. The entire world, and all the inhabited
continents, are pulled into the fight. How did this happen?
You start in June 1940. I said this was the dawn of a new era. The totalitarian states are victorious all
around. The totalitarians between them hold the
balance of world power. Frankly, they can drive the action, unless they start fighting each other,
perhaps out of complacency. Which is, thank goodness for the
democracies, precisely what they do. How did that happen? Let's break down, again, choices that will
change the course of world history that are made in a few world capitals.
Starting with Berlin. What's happening in Berlin?
Well, they have ideas. Remember Hitler's big ideas are about race and space, in German lebensraum, living
room, in which the Germans are going to create a gigantic Eurasian empire, mainly by
expanding eastward at the expense first of these countries in
Eastern Europe, but also looking outward at the
Soviet Union, subjugating and enslaving the inferior
peoples, the Slavs, pushing away and somehow liquidating his
mortal enemy, the Jews, and then, if necessary, fighting his enemies in the West who will
try to keep him from doing that. So in the neighborhood of strategy, what are
the big strategic ideas? Well one big idea would be concentrate on beating the British, concentrate on
occupying their possessions, running into the Middle East, Southwest
Asia, work with your Soviet allies to increase
pressure on them. Actually, the Italians, the Japanese, they
all actually urged Hitler to maybe even form a grand
coalition, maybe even including the Soviets in a
cooperative effort in which they'll start carving up the world
between them. But, of course, to Hitler, this kind of
thinking conflicts with his ideas about putting race and
space foremost and his itch to have that final reckoning
with the Soviet Union, with the Bolsheviks and the Jews that are
over there to the East. So what then is the process by which
Hitler makes these fateful choices? Well, there is a consultative process. He needs his military to write plans. But, this sure is a process dominated by
one man. But when we analyze these key choices,
I've explained again and again, it's useful to understand how people put together their policy options, if you
will. Even if they know what it is they
want to do, they have to formulate some
absolutely critical assessments. So what are the key action judgments that
the German High Command has to make? First, okay, you want to attack the Soviet
Union. Well, is it feasible, militarily feasible? That really is a key assessment done by the German army. They started doing this work in the summer of 1940 for Hitler after the fall of
France. And a key assessment that the German army
takes the lead in forming is that they can beat the Soviets, indeed
that they can beat them rapidly. Are they confident?
Yes. Are they perhaps even a little bit
overconfident? Of course, they look back at what happened
with France. They had doubted their chances there. The Fï¿½hrerï¿½s wisdom had turned out to be
prescient. The Fï¿½hrerï¿½s judgment now is something to
which they're anxious to defer. But they're also caught up in a sense of confidence, even hubris, about what they've
achieved so far. That's their professional military
judgment. But there are other judgments that are
going on. Like how hard will it be to beat the
British? Because they're making this choice between concentrating on the Soviets or
concentrating on the British, and another key assessment is
the British problem is a difficult one. Well, at least for now. The Germans, in effect, launch a massive
probe to check Britain's defenses. To invade Britain, they've got to cross
the English Channel. The British army has lost a lot of it's
heavy equipment. It's relatively weak. But, you have to cross that English
Channel to get at it. To cross the English Channel, the Germans
have to control the skies or else the British navy will
block them. If they can control the skies, they can
sink the British ships. To control the skies, they have to beat
the Royal Air Force. What ensues, then, is a battle over
Britain, the Battle of Britain, fought in the skies over England in the late summer and fall of 1940, that turns out to be very
important. The German air force, the British air
force lose thousands of machines and pilots battling
in the skies. Fundamentally, the German effort to knock out the Royal Air
Force fails. As Winston Churchill said, <Never in the
course of human events have so many owed so much to so
few.> And frustrated, and resentful, especially
now that the British are launching their own little pin prick
bombing raids into Germany, the Germans begin the
wholesale bombing of British cities, including London,
beginning of the fall of 1940. But in doing that, it's also a way of
saying we're not worrying so much about trying to get ready
to invade Britain any more. Though the British are still extremely
worried about that danger well into 1941. Instead, though, Hitler's primary
attention is already shifting away from England as he's
focusing more and more on his hopes for a plan to
get at the Soviets. He's made a tentative decision to move in
that direction by the end of July 1940, but his
intentions harden in the second half of 1940 to full determination
by the end of the year. Now it's time to look very hard at the plans of Germany's critical
strategic partner: the Japanese, their allies in Tokyo. They, too, have ideas about what it is they
want to achieve. That powerful pan-Asian empire, in which Japan will, of course, be the first among the Asian
equals. That empire will be based on huge possessions on the Chinese mainland and
perhaps even on raw materials that might be available
in Southeast Asia in the old European
colonies there. That means the Japanese have to look at
their strategies. The Japanese hate the Soviet Union. In fact, they'd had big border clashes
with the Soviets in 1939, as both sides tested each other's strength
and the Japanese got a bloody nose. The Japanese, though, were looking for their
chance maybe to get at the Soviets but, that's a tough
nut. In 1940, they're looking more at
opportunities elsewhere, in China and in Southeast Asia.
They have a decision to make. Do we go North against the
Soviets? Do we just concentrate on China? Or do we also plunge south and try to
pick up some other low hanging fruit that might
be there. The Japanese also have a process for
making decisions. But there's no clear dictator who's in
charge like there is in Berlin. Instead their process is a highly
bureaucratic one, dominated above all by arguments
between their army and their navy, and then the bureaucracies inside both of those
huge organizations. Deadlocked, both among them and between
them, about what they should do, it's very difficult for them to
arrive at decisions. The civilian rulers are in favor of some sort of expansion, but
people like Prince Konoe are trying to tread
very cautiously for fear of getting into a war with the United States, which he does not
want. So what are the key assessments in Tokyo
in 1940? First, Germany's fortunes are rising.
That's the side you want to be on. That's the model they want to follow.
China, frustrating. They feel like the Chinese already
should've surrendered by now but they keep staying on in the war. And the Japanese are irritated. They think the only reason the Chinese
keep staying in the war is because people like the Americans
and maybe the British let supplies flow into them and keep their
hopes alive. That bothers them a lot. China is swallowing up huge resources of
the Japanese empire and they can't bring it to a
definitive conclusion. Meanwhile, another key assessment, my
goodness look at the opportunities in Southeast
Asia. Why look at the Dutch East Indies, and
where is the Dutch government right now? Oh, sitting in exile in London. And where's the French government right
now? Well, there's a German puppet government
in Vichy, and there's a French government in exile also
in London. So French Indochina looks ripe. As for the British, well they're battered
and overstretched. So all of their rich, material possessions
in Malaya and even the naval base of Singapore might be open
for the picking. Their other key assessment, though, is,
the big obstacle to our plans now is the United States of
America. And the American problem for the Japanese,
all through 1940, is just a really difficult
one. They make a tentative first move. They start moving into the northern part
of French Indochina, around Hanoi. The Americans already react with some
moderate sanctions on the Japanese, almost as a warning shot. The stalemate in Tokyo over what to do
next is going to continue all the way into the
summer of 1941. And what about the United States of America?
This was a really divided country. I'm struck, I read the diaries of the
American historian Arthur Schlesinger, who was a
young man in 1940. He'd lived through the huge protests and
arguments over the Vietnam War later on. But to Schlesinger, looking back on it,
the protests in the Vietnam War, how divided the
country was then, still not comparable to how bitterly and
deeply America had been divided in his youth, in this year, 1940
and in 1941. The most intense political arguments of
his entire lifetime as he remembers it. Because there was a large group of
Americans who believed, passionately, that America had to stand up
to the dictatorships. And there was another really large group
of Americans who believed passionately that the Americans needed to stay out of
those wars, and in particular needed to stay out of
the European war. Indeed, those Americans formed an
America First Committee that had enormous public support, including from some of the best
and brightest of the United States. Here is an example of an America First
Rally. And you can see American flags, American flag bunting, hung everywhere before the
crowd. Concentrate on the United States, don't be
the servant of the British. Irish Americans who hated British were
supporters staying out of the war. The America Firsters crossed all party
lines. One important factor to keep in mind about
the American people, who had really become
more isolationist after the Depression hit in the 1930s, is that they were deeply influenced by
their reading of history. Their reading of history was the reading
of the history of World War One. They looked back in the 1930s on World War
One, the way many Americans now look back on
the Vietnam War. They look back on that as having been a
huge mistake. And wanted to be sure we didn't do
anything that would get us involved in a conflict
like that again. So they passed lots of laws, Neutrality
Acts to keep America from loaning money, from
shipping arms, to be sure that World War One was not
going to happen again. As you can see, memories of history,
recent history, including the First World War,
are in the heads of people in a lot of capitals
in the late 1930s and early 1940s. But the fall of France in June 1940 had
been a terrific shock. In fact, Roosevelt gave his great speech
talking about that shock right here where I'm sitting in
Charlottesville, Virginia. In his Charlottesville address, in the
first week of June 1940, he made it clear that America could not really be
neutral in this kind of conflict. America wasn't going to intervene
militarily, but it did care who won the war. And it was going to do what it could to
help the Allies against the dictatorships.
>> We will extend to the opponents of force the material resources of this
nation. [APPLAUSE].
And at the same time, we will harness and speed up the use of those resources in
order that we, ourselves, and the Americas, may have equipment and training equal to
the task of any emergency and every defense.
[SOUND]. >> Roosevelt then did this
extraordinary thing. He fired his Secretary of War.
He fired his Secretary of the Navy. And he reaches out and forms a national unity of government. Not too dissimilar from what the British
are doing in London. He takes the man who had been Herbert
Hooverï¿½s Republican Secretary of State in the early 1930s, Henry Stimson,
makes him the Secretary of War. He takes the man who had been the
Republican vice presidential candidate in the last election, in 1936, Knox, and makes
him the Secretary of the Navy. In other words, he puts two of the most prominent
Republican statesmen in America in charge of
America's army and navy as he declares a state of national
emergency and begins rushing to prepare America for
what may come. But part of the great argument in the
United States in 1940 and ï¿½41 was what was the realistic
thing to do? Nowadays, you often hear lots of arguments
in which the contrast is offered, including by many
scholars, between idealists and realists, wooly-headed idealists and hard-headed
realists in foreign policy. I actually think this is a false
distinction. People on all sides are suffused with
value judgments that condition the way in which they
filter reality. Take this case in 1940 and ï¿½41. You could be a realist and say, we have to be willing to stand up to the dictators,
or you could be a realist and say, actually our oceans
are giving us a pretty good defense
against the dictators. If we'll stand aside, Hitler and Stalin
will bleed each other to death, and we'll end up being the winners from
these foreign quarrels, just as we've been the winners
from foreign quarrels for most of American history. In fact, America's leading diplomatic
historian at the time, a man named Samuel Flagg Bemis, made precisely this argument, that America had
shown blessed wisdom by staying out of these foreign
controversies. Bemis was an isolationist. Naturally, the American position seemed
irritating to all the foreigners. In Britain, why, Winston Churchill, in his
determination to stand up to Hitler, had bet that
America would be in the war by the end of 1940. That didn't turn out that way. Frustrating, they were on his side, but
couldn't quite give him all of the support he
needed. But, from the point of view of the
Japanese: they make these moves, the Americans start putting sanctions on
them, very irritating. From the point of view of the Germans, the Americans are
starting to try to find ingenious ways of getting
military supplies to their Allied friends, trying
to get around the confining Neutrality Acts passed by
the isolationist Congress. The Germans find that pretty irritating,
too. And Franklin Roosevelt, the President of
the United States, has some pretty serious
dilemmas. He's running for reelection in November
1940. He's running for a third term, something no American president had ever done
before. He's doing it because he thinks his
presidency is indispensable in this time of national
emergency. But in running for the presidency,
Roosevelt's position is: We've got to support the Allies, but we're going to
stay out of the war. Fortunately for Roosevelt, his Republican
opponents are split in their attitudes. They nominate a relative internationalist
in their convention in the summer of 1940. Roosevelt wins reelection. And here is Roosevelt on Election Day in
1940. Meanwhile, Roosevelt's leading advisers
are keenly aware that they no longer really have the ability to shape
events. They're frantically trying, both to rebuild America's strength yet spare
enough supplies to get it somehow especially to
support the British and keep them in the fight. Some of those advisers are men like this
man, Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's right hand man in both domestic affairs
and increasingly in foreign policy. Suffered from a series of illnesses,
always in infirm health. Nonetheless, he's the man masterminding
the ways to get supplies to the Allies short of war. Fortunately, Hopkins has a terrific
relationship with the general who's the chief of staff of the American
army. This man on the left, General George
Marshall. One of Roosevelt's smartest appointments
had been to pluck the relatively unknown Marshall and
put him into the job as Army Chief of Staff, alongside this man, the Secretary of War,
Henry Stimson, a stalwart Republican of the old
progressive international school, who had been the Secretary of State for
Herbert Hoover. These three men that I've shown you all
assumed that at some point America would probably get
into the war. America is already putting together staff
plans for what will happen if they do get into the war. They're Plan D, or Plan Dog, concluded at
the end of 1940 concludes: If and when we do get into the war,
Germany has to be our first priority. Germany First.
It's the most dangerous enemy. But moving back to Europe, let's study the
deadly minuet that's going on between the two dictators,
Stalin and Hitler, partners under the Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact. They're still working on ways to carve up
Eastern Europe even though that causes some friction
between the two of them. Over on the left you see a map that shows you the original plan for how they were
going to partition Europe between them. The areas in orange were going to be in
the Soviet's sphere of influence. The areas in blue were going to be in the
German sphere. And here you see some of the adjustments
that are being made. The Soviets have had their war against
Finland and picked up some territory here. They've grabbed some of Moldavia from
Romania. They've also taken a little piece of
Czechoslovakia over here. The Soviets have also gone ahead and formally annexed the briefly independent countries
of Estonia and Latvia, but, irritating the Germans,
they've gone further and annexed Lithuania as
well. The Germans increasingly swallow their
anger about what the Soviets are doing, because
they're quietly making their own plans for what
they're going to do to the Soviets. Down here in the south, there's more going
on. Remember the Italian empire? Mussolini hadn't given up his ambitions.
He crosses the Adriatic and starts a war to conquer Albania and invade Greece.
But, the Greeks fight well. The Italians are thrown back. And this country right here, Yugoslavia,
has a coup in March 1941 that puts a pro-Allied
government in power. The Yugoslavs and the Greeks are now both
opposed to the Axis. Hitler makes an adjustment in his plans.
The Germans invade the Balkans. In March and April of 1941, they overrun
all of Yugoslavia, all of Greece, and in May even leap over with parachute forces
and conquer the island of Crete in the Eastern
Mediterranean, inflicting another terrible defeat on the
British. Through all this, what are Stalin's
choices? Should Stalin reach out now to the British, and try to make common cause
with them against Hitler? Not his idea at all. Instead what Stalin prefers to do is to
continue his war against internal enemies, including some of the Pols that he's now
brought under his dominion. And then Stalin continues to be a good
friend to Nazi Germany, shipping them tons and tons of raw
materials for their war machine. He doesn't regard himself as naive. He's building up his armed forces. He's making preparations for a possible
war against the Germans. But he's not looking for it. He sends his envoy, Molotov, to Berlin in
the fall of 1940, with all sorts of ideas
about a deal in which the two countries might
cooperate together for expansion at the expense of the British
and their allies. The talks break down, nothing's coming of
it. Stalin's spies are telling him the Germans
are getting ready to attack him. He treats them as being British
provocateurs. So, if you look at the grand strategy of
the Axis Powers, it's hard to find one. Hitler had already made the decision not
to work with the Soviets because he's getting
ready to attack them. In other words, probably the two most
powerful countries in the world in 1940 are getting ready to go to war with each
other in 1941. But even among his other allies, the
Italians and the Japanese, Hitler is doing very little to coordinate
with them and come up with some sort of coalition
strategy. From the point of view of the democracies,
it did turn out to be a good thing that someone who was borderline
insane was in charge of the leading enemy power. Stalin is surprised when the millions of soldiers the Germans
have amassed on his borders then do attack in June of
1941. It's astonishing, in a way, that he was
surprised. He understood that the Germans were
amassing forces, but couldn't really quite believe that they would attack him, in
part, perhaps, because from his point of view, it didn't make sense to him that
Hitler would want to attack him at this stage, just when things
were going so well for Nazi Germany and for the Soviet Union. The German attack on the Soviet Union then
creates a whole new dimension of calculation on the other side of the
world for Washington and Tokyo. And here assessments of what will happen
in that war mean everything for what will happen
in East Asia. See the way these global connections
intertwine. Let's say from the Japanese perspective,
you think the Germans are going to win. Well one option would be, hey let's join in. Let's attack the Soviets up from the
south, and help carve up some of the Soviet
domains. Or you can say hey, the Germans are about
to win, everything's going our way. Now is our moment to move south into
Southeast Asia. But either way, the Japanese are
predicting that the Germans are going to win. The Americans actually are divided about what's going to happen.
But President Roosevelt, aided by advice from Hopkins,
comes to the conclusion that the Soviets might
hold on. Well that's key, because if the Soviets
might hold on, then that creates a much better chance to be able to defeat
Germany in the long run. Therefore, if your grand strategy is
Germany First, keeping the Soviets in the war becomes a prime interest for
the United States. Hm, how can the Americans help keep the
Soviets in the war? Well, for one thing, they can try to make sure the Japanese don't attack the
Soviets. So, when the Japanese take advantage of
this new situation to move further south, occupying the rest of French
Indochina, the Americans take that as the occasion to slap extreme sanctions on the
Japanese. Cutting off vitally needed supplies of
oil. That will help deter the Japanese from
attacking the Soviet Union, and you know what, it did help deter the Japanese
from attacking the Soviet Union. If you pull the tiger's tail real hard, you may get him to turn
around and look at you instead. In the late summer of 1941 then, the
Japanese are debating how to take advantage of this
new situation. Do they move north or do they move south? The United States has adopted their
strategy. They're going to put sanctions on the Japanese and deter them from starting a
war. But, that's not the choice the Japanese
end up making. Instead, during a period of deliberations
between about mid- August and early September 1941, they
decide it's war, unless we can settle our differences with the United States on terms favorable to
us. And it's war with the United States and
everybody else as we move south. The British, the Dutch,
we're going to occupy those areas of Southeast Asia, and since
we think the Americans won't leave us alone, we can't
leave the Americans alone. We have to get ready to attack them, too. By the way, why were they so worried about
the Americans? And here, it's an ironic consequence of
the fact that the Americans had the
Philippines and also Hawaii.
But especially the Philippines. The Americans have bases in the
Philippines. If you leave those bases alone, they're
right there next to Southeast Asia. If the Americans hadn't been in the
Philippines at all, if McKinley hadn't decided to take them in
1898 and the nearest American bases were
thousands of miles away, it's not clear the Japanese would have
felt they had to go to war with the United States in 1941
at all. Of course, on the other hand, if America hadn't annexed Hawaii in 1898, any capacity for
America to have interfered in events in the Far
East would have been almost non-existent. So as the Japanese make their choice, this man, Prince Konoe, who had been
worried about war with the United States and feared where Japan was going,
is pushed out of the lead. Instead, taking his place, is this man, General Hideki Tojo. He can bring together the army and the
navy, finally reconciling their points of view in a
lowest common denominator position: that it's going to be war moving
south, unless the United States will go along with what
the Japanese want. The last critical stage that will lead to
all out global war is this question: Why no modus vivendi? That is, the Japanese are reaching out for
some sort of negotiated settlement with the United
States to avoid war. The Americans understand that the Japanese are looking for something, and the
American's have some interest in getting an agreement
with the Japanese that will avoid war. In other words, they want to find
some way of just getting along. A modus vivendi. So why can't the Japanese and the
Americans find some way of kicking the can down the road? Well part of it is, the Japanese want the
Americans to fundamentally go along with their
continued expansion in China. And frankly, from the very start, this
issue of Japanese expansion in China had been something the Americans
were unwilling to accept. The American commitment to China's future
is an absolutely critical cause of American entry into
World War Two. By the way, it's mainly for reasons of
American attachment to Chinese hopes. It's not because of American trade with
China. In fact, American trade with Japan is much
larger than its trade with China in the 1930s and
early 1940s. They also worry about discouraging their
British and Chinese allies, because they're anxious about Allied
resolve to stay in the fight. But the Americans weren't looking to have
a war with the Japanese. After all, remember, the American grand strategy is Germany First, not Japan
First. So, if the Americans are getting into a
war with Japan before they get into a war with Germany, they've
turned their grand strategy upside down. Meanwhile on the Japanese side, they're
just not willing to compromise on the fundamental
geopolitical ambitions of the empire. And also the Germans are egging them on, saying yeah, go have a war with the United
States. They've been irritating us a lot, too. They've been interfering with our
submarine warfare in the Atlantic against the
British. And if you'll get into a war with the
United States, we, the Germans, we'll join in with you, we'll
declare war on them, too. So, no modus vivendi. Well, that turns out to be really important, because, for instance, you saw
that I pointed out how important it was that the
Japanese thought that the Germans were winning their war
against the Soviet Union. At the point the Japanese make these key
decisions in the fall of 1941, it's looking pretty good for the Germans
in their war against the Soviets. If those decisions had been kicked down
the road for a few months, say into early 1942, when German
prospects in the Soviet war don't look so good, would the Japanese still have made all the same decisions?
Hard to say. The Japanese were faced with a stark
choice. The Americans had placed sanctions on them
such that either Japan reconciled differences and tried to work for more
cooperative approach in the Pacific. Or, if Japan was determined to retain its
alliance with Germany, determined to remain on a path of imperial expansion,
it faced the only other choice available, which was all-out war, even if the Japanese themselves couldn't
quite figure out how, in the long run, they'd be able to win it. So the Japanese choose war. They attack the United States on December
7, 1941. Several days later, the Germans keep their
promise, and also declare war on the United States,
too. Let's just reflect for a moment on two key gambles, dice rolls that are being
made by the leading powers. First, they're making a key judgment about
the outcome of the German-Soviet war. If you're sure the Germans are going to
win, that's one set of policies. If you think the Soviets can hold on,
another set of policies. The Japanese have gambled pretty heavily
that the Germans are going to do well there. The Americans, in turn, have made some important judgments that
the Soviets might hold on. And the other big gamble is on American
capacity. If the Americans get into the war, just
how powerful can they be? The Japanese are gambling that they can
run wild long enough that the Americans will find it too difficult
to recover and get back. It will take them too long, be too
expensive. The Germans are gambling that they can knock out the
Soviet Union, consolidate their gains, before a substantial American
military power can be brought to bear. Distantly reminiscent of the gamble the
Germans made at the beginning of 1917, too. We'll see how those gambles turn out, next
time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
