Hi welcome back.
You know among a lot of people after World War I there was a broad sense that they
were living in a broken world. To try to characterize the period of the
1920s, I was looking for a phrase, letï¿½s try: The Age of Uncertainty. Literally, an age in which the
certainties of the past seemed gone. We can measure this in physical terms.
We can talk about human losses. Killed in action in World War I itself,
estimates probably in the range of 9,000,000 to
10,000,000 killed. Not all the mutilated, wounded, and the
rest, which are tens of millions more of people damaged in some way physically or
psychologically by the war and who survived. The Russian Civil War had millions more. Other wars, like the wars that convulsed
what we now call Turkey, another huge casualty
list. And then we can go on. So physical loss is enormous.
On top of that the conditions of the war helped produce the worst outbreak of
disease in modern history: the Great Influenza Epidemic of 1918-
1919, which probably killed more people than lost their lives in combat. Some number between ten to twenty million,
maybe even more. So, large human losses. By the way, one thing about World War One
that's interesting, is leaving aside the civil wars, during the war itself, 90 percent
of the people killed were soldiers. So this is not a war like World War Two,
where a majority of the people killed in the war were not soldiers. In World War I, in the fronts where the
fighting was going on the casualties were concentrated
overwhelmingly among people who were in uniform. So the human loss is enormous of course,
physical devastation really marked the demographies of countries like Germany, France, Britain,
Russia. Some smaller countries like Serbia,
Bulgaria. But I think contemporaries felt even more
profoundly a sense of spiritual loss. The loss, in a way, of an old order of
things, of a society that was genteel.
The society of gentlemen and ladies that people would look back on with a glow
of nostalgia around those pre-war days: the Edwardian Era, the Victorian Era. That era of gentlemen and their servants,
so person on the left dressed in his Edwardian
outfit with top hat now replaced by a little bit of the new man wearing clothes that we would find more
recognizable today. That's by the way, the author F. Scott Fitzgerald, one of the great 1920s
chroniclers of the sense of what was lost. But also lost is a sense of confidence. The 19th century had been that great age
of discovery. They felt like they were figuring a lot of
things out. Confidence in what? Confidence in progress, that the world had
been just driving forward into new and higher
things. Well maybe we were driving forward to new
things, but maybe they weren't higher. So there was a sense of loss of confidence
in progress, but also loss in confidence that people were sure they knew what was
right and what was right for other people. In politics. Even in religion. So for instance, one of the great social
movements in Britain, France, America in the late 1800s, early
1900s is the mission movement. Bringing Christian faith to the heathen. Bringing light to areas of spiritual
darkness. It can seem odd to us to even use phrases like
that now. But that's something that happened. And it's something that's lost in a sense. Here's a picture, for instance, of an American mission running a school in
China. This picture was taken in 1900. If you look in the very back of the
photograph you see that American woman helping to run the school with all
of her students. You have to have a certain sense of
confidence in your beliefs and in the importance of
bringing those beliefs to others that would get an American
woman, maybe from Kansas, to think: I'm going to go out into
China. I'm going to start a school there. because I think I can bring them something
helpful. Education. I'm going to start a hospital, I'm
going to start a church to preach the gospel. And we can make fun, and people at the time did make fun of how patronizing it
all seemed. How often hypocritical, how blind many of
the missionaries were to the local ways that they were trying to overthrow or
upset. And there was some significant reactions
to that, including in China in 1900, as we learned about it in a previous
discussion. But it is also worth just also noting what was
lost when the zealous belief that you had something to say, something to preach,
diminishes. Another thing that's lost along with some
uncertainty about the inexorable march of progress is faith
almost in rationality itself. The results of the war seemed so crazily
disproportionate to anyone's open purposes that it caused people to
doubt almost reason itself. The search for the real forces beneath the
surface could, for example, take you more in the direction of Marxism, which would
argue that all that rhetoric is just a disguise for the real
clash of forces, the objective conditions lying beneath. In fact, a whole school of philosophy, call
it critical theory, will rise up, partly inspired by Marxism but partly too
on a general sense that beneath the veneer of what we say are
rationale purposes we're hiding deeper subjective constructs of the
way we really want to world to be, that we express in our
seeming vocabulary of rationality. If you want to look even harder for what
lies beneath the surface, you'd go past the conscious self
altogether and into the subconscious. And this period we're looking at, the
19-teens, 1920s, are the great rise of interest in the
subconscious. The great era of popularization of works of
men like Sigmund Freud, here on the left, or Carl Jung, here on the
right. The rise of modern psychiatry and
psychoanalysis, attention to subconscious motives and drives. One of the interesting things about
Architecture, and the way architecture develops in the
1920s, is its almost attempting to reassert a new
faith in rationality. Lets just take a look, for example, at one of
the great symbols of modern architecture. This is Walter Gropius, on the left, and on the right is his famous Bauhaus
architecture. To our eyes today this looks like a pretty commonplace sort of modern building. It didn't look so commonplace to people in
the 1920s. Well, what's going on here? It's unadorned, no curlicues, straight lines, functional, natural, rational.
The building has a purpose. It's constructed to fit this purpose. And it's a clean, pure expression of that
purpose, without all the veneer
on top of it. Understand that and you get at a lot of
this whole spirit of this architectural movement, which has
influenced so much of what we see all around us today. Another really interesting expression of
looking beyond a normal rationality in art or philosophy is
Futurism. You'll remember, in another presentation,
I used Henry Adams, and I talked a lot about Adams's focus on forces. The forces of magnetic attraction
represented by faith and things like the Virgin, as opposed to the modern forces that
seemed to him to be forces that were moving out of control, the forces of the dynamo, forces of anarchy and
disintegration. What Futurism represented and its main
sources of philosophy and literature were in Italy in the early
1900s, is actually a celebration of the force
itself, a celebration of dynamism. Take a look, for example of the famous sculpture by the Italian, Umberto
Boccioni. The sculpture is from 1913, the sculpture
was entitled: Unique Forms of Continuity in Space. He's trying to capture in an abstract
sculpture pure, driving motion, muscle power itself, the essence
of it. By the way, the Futurists translated a lot
of their celebration of dynamism into the desire for the nation
to express that force. So they were strong nationalists. The Futurists were big supporters, for
instance, of Italy's entry into World War I. Sculptor Boccioni, who executed this work
of art, joined the Italian army. He was killed in a training accident in
1916. It's interesting to notice, then, the
relationship between Futurism and fascism. Don't think of fascism as a reactionary
doctrine. The fascists thought of themselves as
extremely modern. Study, for instance, the words of Benito Mussolini who helped define what fascism
meant. Fascism, he wrote, desires an active man, one engaged in activity with all his
energies: it desires a man virilely conscious of the difficulties that exist
in action and ready to face them. It conceives of life as a struggle,
considering that it behooves man to conquer for himself that
life truly worthy of him, creating first of all in himself the
instrument in order to construct it. What does he mean by this kind of
struggle? He means the struggle through the
identification with the State. Against individualism, the Fascist
conception is for the State. And it is for the individual, in so far as
he coincides with the State, which is the conscience and universal will
of man in his historical existence. It is opposed to classical Liberalism,
which arose from the necessity of reacting against absolutism, monarchies
for example. And which brought its historical purpose
to an end when the State was transformed into the conscience and will of the
people. By the way, Mussolini's argument is not
that the nation created the state, but that the state now recreates the
nation in its desired image, through the will and the purposes of the
people who identify with the state. Remolding the world. Liberalism denied the State in the
interests of the particular individual. Fascism reaffirms the state as the true
reality of the individual. Therefore, he goes on, for the Fascist,
everything is in the State, and nothing human or spiritual
exists, much less has Value, outside the State.
In this sense fascism is totalitarian. In the fascist state, the synthesis and
unity of all values interprets, develops, and gives strength
to the whole life of the people. You can get a sense of Mussolini's ideas carried forward into the art of a
Futurist like Gerardo Dottori. This is an image of Mussolini. You can see the, how the airplanes,
machines, their power, all blend into the image of Italy's leader.
The symbol of national force. And Mussolini picks up his own
interpretation of the age of uncertainty, going on to argue that: Now liberalism. Heï¿½s writing 
in the 1920s, is about to close the doors of
its deserted temples because the peoples feel that it's agnosticism in
economics, it's indifferentism in politics and in morals, would lead, as
they have led he states, to certain ruin. Remarking on the aftermath of World War I. In this way, one can understand why all
the political experiences of the contemporary world are anti-liberal. Well, to offer the one other side of the
experience of the contemporary world, let's look at that emblem of materialism that Mussolini so detested, the global
America. You remember we talked about the rise of a global Europe in the 1700s and into the
1800s? The rise of the global America in the 20th
century, which is really becoming evident in the aftermath of World
War I, in the 1920s and beyond, is not because America had become the
supreme military power of the world. Actually, right after the war was over,
America mostly scrapped its army. It kept a substantial navy. But America was not a supreme military
power in the world. It was not even wielding its diplomatic
influence in every conflict, though it was much more
significant. then it had been. The real influence of the global America
actually came from the American economy, American finance,
and above all, American culture. It becomes the representative for a new
way of living. We might deride that way of living as the
rise of consumerism, of mass market advertising, of seducing
people to buy a lot of things they don't need. But America seemed to represent, above
all, the production of an abundance of
household goods, of the material well-being of ordinary people, supplied through a free
market. So, for instance, here's a page from a
Sears Roebuck catalog, giving people access to household goods by
mail. And if you look at the kind of goods they're advertising here, you can see
they're pretty mundane things. Here's a way to improve your sewing
machine. If your home is hot in the summertime, Sears is helping you buy larger electric
fans, even a kind that will oscillate. Or if you're cold in the wintertime,
here's an electric radiator. America too was the emblem of that great 20th century technology
that would so transform the physical face of modern
life: cars. Highways, gas stations, drive-in movie
theaters. The Americans were the world's premiere
producer of affordable automobiles. Here's an example of the smile-car sedan. And, of course, people are hearing more
about these goods, not only through newspapers
and magazines, but also through the new marvel of
broadcast radio. The telegraph had been supplanted by a wireless, a Marconi set, in which
people could transport signals without wires, using the electromagnetic spectrum.
That had been developed in the late 1800s. What arises after World War I is broadcast
radio, in which radio signals can simply be sent out to
millions, tens of millions of listeners. For instance, this illustration is one of
the earliest kinds of broadcast radio, in which people are listening in on their
own headsets to what's being sent out over the
airwaves. Very quickly, this will be supplanted by a
set-top box in which people will just simply sit by their radio, listening
to what's coming out of the speakers. It's just worth kind of pausing for a moment and thinking about the impact of
radio. Because for all the globalize world people lived in the 1920s, communities still felt
really local, most of the interactions you had in your daily life were just with local
people. With radio, for the first time, you can sit
down in evening and just listen to people talking at you from thousands of
miles away, in real time. [LAUGH] In a way like I can talk to you
now. And another supreme example of American
cultural impact is through the movies. The Americans aren't the only ones to make
movies; it's not just Hollywood. But Hollywood is a premier producer of
movies for common people everywhere, movies with
universal appeal, with stars like the British vaudevillian,
Charlie Chaplin in silent movies that could be understood
anywhere. Again, the creation of a global culture.
A universal culture. Let's talk some more about the ways
society really changes in the fundamental relations of men and
women, next time. See you then.
