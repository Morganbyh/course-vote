Hi, welcome back. In this segment we're going to focus on
how two Europes get created in the late 1940s. And the key event in this period is the
famous Marshall Plan, kind of his great response to those failures I talked about in the last
presentation. Of course, it's called the Marshall Plan. That was a deliberate decision because
Marshall was a lot more popular than President
Truman and so the hope was calling it the Marshall Plan will raise the odds
of getting it through Congress. But it wasn't just about George Marshall. This was really a team effort, and it's
worth kind of noting some of the members of the American team,
very different kinds of people. This man on the left, Dean Acheson. The number two man in the State Department
at the beginning of ï¿½47, left government, but
played a key role. He was a figure who had ideas about how
to manage this politically, stressing the
anti-communist message to Congress cause he knew that would be popular, sensitive to economics in
rebuilding a world of more liberal free trade. A key role played by this man, George
Kennan, developing an idea of the need to contain Soviet Communism, but not to
counterattack it. If you can just contain it, it will expire
of its own contradictions. But to contain it, he didn't want a
military confrontation. He thought you needed an economic revival
in Western Europe, and one with a relatively light hand from
the United States. Or this man, who often isn't given enough
attention. This man is Will Clayton. He was the person running economic policy
at the State Department, a key figure in the Marshall Plan story.
His background is interesting. He comes from Texas. He was involved with a firm called
Anderson Clayton that was a huge broker of cotton
sales. That's right, cotton. And like many Southerners involved in the cotton trade, a big advocate of free
trade. And he was trying to figure out how to
revive the world trading system. And of course one reason the Europeans
couldn't buy things in world trade, especially from America,
is they didn't have hard currency.
They didn't have enough dollars. So how do you solve that problem? We have this image now of the Marshall
Plan as, well, that's just this big foreign aid
effort. We were very generous, and we gave the
Europeans tons of money and got them on their feet. And that's a kind of good cartoon story
for the Marshall Plan. But you can't learn anything from it. Because the notion of creating another
such foreign aid program to solve our problems misses what really
made the Marshall Plan work. More devilish details. I'll just call out two particular details
that are really interesting about the way the
Marshall Plan was designed. First off, this was not just giving the Europeans a
bunch of money and then getting them to put it to work in
rebuilding their countries. This is really telling the Europeans: The Europeans write a shopping list.
You know how to write a shopping list. Here's the stuff we wish we could buy if
we had a lot of dollars. And then the American government is their
purchasing agent, in effect. We'll go buy it. And, of course, who are we
going to buy if from? We'll buy it from Americans.
So think about that. The Europeans form the shopping list. We'll spend our money buying stuff from
Americans. Well, that has some political arguments
going for it. But the Europeans like that, because
you're giving them the money, the funds that they can use in making massive
purchases from the United States that, otherwise, they couldn't afford to
make. That then helped them build up their economies, get their trade restarted
again. Here's another key ingredient. For the Europeans to participate, they
have to kind of get together and not only cooperate on the
shopping list, but they had to agree as a condition that
they would organize and cooperate with each other and
knock down the trade barriers inside Europe. We weren't going to deal with eight
European countries each with its own trade walls. We believed knock down your trading
barriers inside Europe, so that you have good economic space between you
and can work together, then you can participate in putting
together your shopping list for us. So European cooperation and European initiative are key elements of
this design. A design that was based on the premise
that if they had dollars, that's kind of the ignition fuel they
need to get their economies going again. That meant that the Europeans were
going to have to work together; they were going to have to be
interdependent. But interdependence also had political
implications. It meant that the kind of political rivalries before the war were going to
have to be downplayed, have to be muted, for this
plan to work. So it's enormously important political
agenda for the European participants, not just
economics. Now, of course, at the point you're
organizing this, the people who want to take part are going to be people getting involved in a
really close relationship with each other and with the
United States. And the attitudes toward that vary
depending on who you ask. Of course, from the communist point of
view, everything about this is wrong. The Americans are the hub, not the
Soviets. That's bad, both politically and
economically. The cooperative elements imply free trade
and a capitalist economic system -- incompatible with communism. And since the
Soviet government is looking forward to the communization of
all these countries, they, in effect, prevent all the
countries where they have influence from participating in
the Marshall Plan. So if you're an American editorial writer,
here's the way you see the Soviet role. The Marshall Plan's trying to score for a European recovery, but there's Stalin
trying to block the goal. Or, from a European perspective, this is
the kind of propaganda for the Marshall Plan but -- Whatever the
weather we must move together. [LAUGH] Can you imagine this kind of image even being put on a wall in the 1930s? Or, if you adopted the Soviet point of view, here's their caricature:
that's the Statue of Liberty. That face, that's the face of George
Marshall; he's holding up the big money bag,
dollars. Marshall Plan is written on this document,
and whatï¿½s happening is he expects everyone to just kind of
kowtow and bow down before the power of the
almighty dollar. That's the Soviet image of the Marshall
Plan. So what are the effects, then, of the Marshall Plan's adoption and
implementation in ï¿½47, ï¿½48, and as it really gets going in the
late 40s and even into the early 1950s? Perhaps the most important effect, overall,
is psychological. It's not like all of a sudden, you start
putting, you start announcing this in the middle of 1947 and
economies are wonderful again. In a way, so much of the attitude here is: You've
got a glass that's half full. The attitude is: Is this glass draining or
filling? And what the Marshall Plan did is it made people have a sense that the glass was
filling. It gave them confidence about the future. Political, economic confidence about the
future. That was what was so important about it. There are arguments among the economists
about whether it really had a big economic impact. Alan Milward, for example, says not so
much, the European economies were beginning to
recover anyway. I think there are some pretty good
economic arguments on the other side, about the objective impact of the infusion
of the American funds in this way, but the political impact of what this is doing, and the psychological impact,
are irrefutable. What it also creates is a whole vision for Western Europe as a cooperative entity, combining its
resources. That's very, very powerful. Let's look at the way this played out in
European politics right after the war. You remember this kind of chart. This showed you the, kind of the basic families of political beliefs right after
the war. Fascist diminished, National
Conservatives, Liberals, Social Democrats, Democratic
Socialists, Communists. So, here's a pie chart, showing you the results of the French legislative
elections in November 1946. Right wing monarchist stuff, it's off the
radar of French politics. There are some Gaullists who are beginning
to organize on the right, disdainful of the
party politics represented by the pre-war era,
but in this new Fourth French Republic that replaced the Third
Republic destroyed in the war, this is a very leftist orientation. You
see the communists are at the very height of their
power; they'll never get more votes than this in
a French legislative election. The Democratic Socialists, pretty strong.
And the Social Democrats, quite strong. The big three make up the dominant
coalition in 1947, with the communist sharing power in
the French government. But because of the break over the Marshall
Plan, the big three break. The communists launch a general strike in
1947. They're pushed out of power. Instead, the Social Democrats form the hub
of what will become a new coalition of ruling parties in France. Just a reminder of what we did in another slide, what do we mean by Social
Democrats? What do they stand for? In Europe as well as in America, this was
a lot of the basic menu. We went over this before. The only thing I would like to point out
again, as you review this slide, is the implications
for politics big and little. By big it means, big government, big companies, big unions,
free market, but with a strong government role. But a lot of interdependence. A lot of institution building and
cooperation. That has a small political effect in the
way people have to work together, as well as
the larger impact that we're seeing in the division
of one Europe that's pointing towards the West
and another that's oriented around the Soviet Union. The Social Democrats, sometimes called
Christian Democrats in Western Europe, they become the key centrist force
emerging in the late 1940s. They're well represented by these two men,
both Frenchmen, key political allies. This man on the left, Jean Monnet, this
man on the right, Schuman. Schuman is a really good representative of
the new France: 
grew up in Alsace, actually was in the German army during
World War I, then became part of the new France,
devoted to the new France. He actually becomes France's foreign
minister. He's cooperating a lot with this man,
Monnet, a former champagne salesman, who becomes a
key economic planner. Both these men, by heritage, by
background, are committed to a world of international cooperation, of bridging the old pre-war differences, of getting Western Europeans to work
together. Now, on the other hand, there's another
vision for Eastern Europe. In Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union is
increasingly tightening its grip. In 1947, ï¿½48, ï¿½49. That's tragic story for the fate of
Eastern Europe. Recently the historian Anne Applebaum has
written a detailed book chronicling just what happened in
each of these countries as the Soviets subverted democratic forces and made sure
that they and their allies seized power, by coercive means if
necessary, throughout this zone, with the West essentially helpless to
intervene, to do anything about it. That naturally created some flashpoints,
in places where it wasn't clear whether it would go democratic or
communist, like Czechoslovakia. The communist coup that overthrew the government of shared
power and replaced it with a communist
government in 1948, it shocked the West. Because remember, only ten years earlier,
the whole cause of Czechoslovakia had been on the headlines
all through the Western world, when the Germans were exerting their
pressure on Czechoslovakia. So people were conditioned to care more
about what happened when Czechoslovakia was taken
over by the communists and its foreign minister, the famous statesman Masaryk, mysteriously
committed suicide. But there are other flashpoints, above all,
again, Germany. Divided Germany now becomes a polarized
division with divided Berlin at the heart of it, in the middle of the Soviet
zone of occupation. And in 1948, as the West begins converting
its zones of occupation to a new capitalist system, the
Soviets strike back. They cut Berlin off from ordinary road
supplies, forcing Berlin to be kept afloat through an
airlift of supplies. But that was a move that backfired. It created iconic images like this one.
Study this photograph. Here are German children, standing on what
looks like a hillside, that's actually a huge pile of rubble,
from the destroyed wreckage of Berlin, and instead of American aircraft
destroying Berlin, they're all standing there watching
American transport aircraft coming in for a landing, bringing vitally needed supplies to the people of
Berlin. Images like this had a galvanizing effect
on Europe and kind of clarifying here are the two Europes that are coming
into existence. Which side are we going to be on? Let's stop there and next time, let's see
what's happening in Asia. [BLANK_AUDIO]
