Hi.
Welcome back. What I want to do in this presentation is
talk about how the Korean War intensified so it felt like World War
III was about to begin. Remember back when we talked about World
War II, how it seemed like at these regional wars
in Europe and in Asia, and then, by the end of ï¿½41, they combine into
being an all-out global war? People in 1950 remembered all of that. They remembered how a regional war, war
over Poland, turned fairly quickly into a much, much
larger war. They thought that was happening again.
Let's look at what happened. In September of 1950, the Americans get
enough forces in that they can turn the tide. They have a huge advantage. They control the air and the sea.
They launch an invasion, actually an incredibly high
risk invasion, right here, behind North Korean
lines. The North Korean resistance collapses, you
can see with all these blue arrows the U.S./U.N.
forces. By the way the British, the French, the
Turks are all sending troop contingents to fight
alongside the Americans and the South Koreans. They begin driving North Korean forces and are overrunning the country. You'll encounter an argument in some of
the history books that said that the United States and UN forces should have stopped right here and not kept going
North. That's a bit of a hindsight point of view.
There are a handful of people who made that argument
at the time. There was no chance that that argument
would prevail at the top of the United States
government. They had just come out of a war where when dictators
committed aggression against you, you had to utterly
defeat the dictators rather than push them back to the start
line and then wait for them to try again. So at the top of the U.S. government, there's just no question that North Korea, having committed aggression, North Korea
will be destroyed the same way that Hitler's Germany was destroyed or Japan had to submit
unconditional surrender. They're going to unify the peninsula and
organize it along the lines preferred by the United
Nations. They drive north. So now the issue is this: From the point of view of the North Korean
leaders and their Chinese and Soviet allies, what
do you do? Do you allow North Korea to be defeated? You remember that when Stalin authorized
this invasion, he had estimated the U.S. would not
interfere. That gamble had been proven wrong. But he had also counted on the Chinese being able to help in case things turned
bad. And that's exactly what he does now: he
argues that the Chinese need to go to war against the United
States and the United Nations. There are critical deliberations among the
Chinese leaders about this. Actually, a pretty sizable fraction of the Chinese communist
leadership does not want the larger war. They want to concentrate on building the
new People's Republic. Above all, the leading advocate for a
larger war is Mao Zedong himself, seen here conferring with his key general,
Peng Dehuai. In the back and forth, Mao is asking Stalin for assurances of equipment,
supplies, air cover if Mao was willing to bring
China into the war against the United States, which of course, obviously threatens a wider war with
China, with whom the Soviet Union is allied. You can just very quickly see how this can
turn into World War III. Stalin sees that, too. So if you want to get a glimpse into how
they're working through this problem, take a look at this exchange in which
Stalin is making his argument to Mao [about] why China should go to war against
America, even at the risk of World War III. You see his reasoning in this written
communication. The USA, not ready for a big war.
Japan, not capable of giving much help to the
Americans. The USA will be compelled to yield to
China, behind which stands the Soviet Union, for the same reason the
USA will not only have to abandon Taiwan, which is
what China really wants to take care of, but also reject the idea of a separate
peace with the Japanese reactionaries -- because the
Americans are moving toward signing a peace treaty settling the issues of the war with
Japan. Of course, Stalin writes, I took into
account, also, the possibility that the USA, despite it's
unreadiness for a big war, could still be drawn into a big war, out of prestige, which in
turn would drag China into the war. And along with this, draw into the war,
the Soviet Union, which is bound with China by the
Mutual Assistance Pact. In other words, World War III.
Should we fear this? In my opinion, we should not, because
together we will be stronger than the USA and England while
the other European capitalist states, with the
exception of Germany, which is unable to provide any assistance to the
United States now, do not present serious military forces. If a war is inevitable, then let it be
waged now, and not in a few years when Japanese militarism will be restored as an
ally of the USA. Mao accepts this reasoning and decides to
bring China into the fight. A critical enabler for his success are
decisions that are made by the United States and the United
Nations in October and November. The Chinese are willing to mass hundreds of thousands of soldiers for a massive
offensive. But they, in theory, ought to be beaten in
this offensive, because the United States and its allies
have complete control of the skies and airpower. They have control of the seas. They have much better firepower, heavy
artillery, that can be used. The Chinese forces are relatively lightly
equipped. So how is it possible that a Chinese
offensive could succeed? It can work if the US and the UN forces are scattered over a
mountainous countryside. They're not in prepared positions where
their firepower can be brought up with the necessary supplies to
provide all the needed support. That's exactly what the US and UN forces allowed to have happen in October and
November. Even though the Chinese launched some
startling attacks in October of 1950 that are
probing attacks, that they then stop and pull back
from, Douglas MacArthur, commanding the US and
UN forces, continues to scatter his forces across the mountains
of North Korea. The thing to notice in this map is his
forces are here along a thin line here. This is all open space, another position
here, another position here, here, here. The Chinese, lightly armed, position
themselves to infiltrate in all the areas around these forces, in
and through their lines, cutting them off and then ambushing them as they try to
retreat along narrow mountainous valleys, fighting at night, in the winter, in the
mountains. Instead, what MacArthur could have done,
especially once he realized that there was a significant risk the
Chinese might come in, is he could have prepared his forces along
this line right here, the Wonsan Neck. This was actually considered by military
planners at the time. You'd have held Pyongyang. You'd have a lot of the key area of North Korea; you could consolidate your
position, bringing up your forces, and hedge against the risk of a Chinese
attack instead of scattering forces to the countryside in the hope of winning the war
and having the troops home by Christmas. But MacArthur, overconfident, did not hedge
against that risk. When the Chinese hit hard, just before
Thanksgiving in 1950, the American, the South Korean, US, UN lines break, collapse, and there's a
headlong retreat. The United States finds itself in an
entirely new war. Not only are they now fighting China, they're now fighting China with their
forces fleeing in retreat and with the United States contemplating a
wider war against China that can bring in the Soviet Union.
World War III. This map readily shows the gains the
Chinese made by the beginning of 1951. Again invading Seoul, pushing down past
the 38th parallel, Mao hopes to completely overrun South Korea and push the US and UN forces
entirely off the peninsula. The United States, thoroughly alarmed, calls up
reserves, engages in a national mobilization, declares a
national emergency, triples the defense budget virtually
overnight, just as it did at the outbreak of World War III. They're able to hold the line in Korea
through the determined fighting of American, South Korean, British, French,
and other allied forces, holding the line under the leadership, Especially, of this general, Matthew
Ridgway, he's the fellow with the hand grenade
attached to his shoulder strap. This map shows how the line stabilized. Ignore the fact that they've misspelled
the word ï¿½armistice,ï¿½ that ï¿½aï¿½ should be an ï¿½i.ï¿½ The battle in Korea turns into years of
trench warfare in the mud and in the cold mountains, as you can see from these
scattered images. The Chinese loose hundreds of thousands of
soldiers. The South Koreans, Americans, and their
allies hang on. American combat forces are now integrated,
black and white, as this photograph shows. But another way that the United States
held the line, it decided not to widen the war into World
War III. General MacArthur argued expressly for
involving Nationalist Chinese in the war and for expanding the war to mainland
China itself. President Truman, egged on by the worried
British prime minister, decides not to widen the
war. That tension finally leads to Truman
having to fire his commanding general, Douglas
MacArthur, in April 1951. McArthur comes home to get ticker tape
parades. He's celebrated as the conquering hero, come back to
confront his timid civilian bosses. But in months of hearings, Americans hear
from their generals that they had reached the conclusion that
having World War III start in Korea would have been the wrong war, at the wrong
time, and against the wrong enemy.
