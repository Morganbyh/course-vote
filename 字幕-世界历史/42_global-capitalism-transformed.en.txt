Hi, welcome back. In this presentation, we're going to
discuss how the world's economic system got to be pretty much the economic
system we have today. So an interesting topic, but actually one
on which it's hard to find a very good historical
literature. The first big series of changes have to do
with the fate of China. Remember back in the last presentation, I talked about
the way you could think of this phase of global history in the ï¿½70s and
ï¿½80s as a kind of global election, choosing among different sets of ideas of fow to solve these problems of systemic
crisis that seemed evident in the ï¿½70s. Alright. And then I invited you to think about
which parts of the world would be the sort of swing
states, swing regions in this global election, and I suggested that it seemed to me that
the two really swing regions were Europe, especially Western and Central
Europe, and East Asia, especially China. Last time we talked a lot about the way
Europe swung in the ï¿½70s and ï¿½80s. Now I want to concentrate a little bit on
what happened in China. Mao Zedong died in 1976. One of the first issues that arose after
Mao's death is literally what to do with the
body. The precedent in the Soviet Union was to
turn these iconic figures of communist hero worship literally into
embalmed mummies on public display, objects of veneration in almost a sort of
quasi-secular worship. So the mummified bodies of both Lenin and
Stalin were on display. As Stalin slightly fell out of favor, his
body was quietly put away. Lenin's is still on display. So one of the issues for the Chinese is
whether they should do the same. It's kind of a revealing issue. Because in a way, you're deciding what
role Mao should play in Chinese political culture
in the years to come. Their decision was to turn Mao into the embalmed mummy too, also suitable for
public display. So after Mao's death, imagine that you're one of the people influencing the Chinese
leadership. You're asking yourself, what do we want
China to become now? Think about the menu of options that you
might have considered. Among the Chinese factions, four different kinds of visions emerged.
One would be more of a revolutionary socialist vision and even more aggressive pursuit of communism, akin to the days of the Cultural Revolution. Mao's widow and some of the people around
her counted themselves in that camp. Others preferred more of a Soviet-style communism, concentrating on building up heavy industry, stronger state planning.
The third camp, I might call national conservatives with Chinese characteristics. I'm afraid I'm borrowing a little
bit from the phrase the Chinese leadership uses now, in
which they say they have socialism with Chinese
characteristics. I've categorized a family of ideas as
national conservatives that are top-down modernizers. Some of those national conservative
leaders can be more autocratic, giving less scope for
democratic processes. I think the Chinese characteristics among
this group would be strong central management with partnerships between
private entrepreneurs and the strong central government.
A fourth school might be a little more liberal,
might be more like the social democracy that one encounters, say, in Western
Europe. These four different factions have it out.
The first loser in this battle is here. Mao's widow and the group of people around
her were actually tried as enemies of the people and were pushed
out of Chinese public life. What seemed to take their place a year or
two later was a group led by Hua Guofeng that seemed to favor this
camp, also favoring better relations with the
Soviet Union. But there was a critical leadership battle
in 1977 and 1978, culminating in a critical party congress at the end of
1978, in which, really, this group gets the
upper hand, led by a man named Deng Xiaoping. So now we're down at the end of 1978 and
into 1979 with two key visions. This sort of national conservative vision
that I've described. And then a group of people who were advocating going still
further in a liberal direction, more of the social
democratic thrust. Okay, I've sketched out a little bit what
happened. But then you might ask, well why? Why did it narrow down to those two? Why did the camp that favored more of the Soviet-style approach lose out in this
struggle? Some of the reasons have to do with
personal and factional rivalries. But another had to do with what people
might have seen if they looked around the world in
the late 1970s. So to kind of get a sense of what someone
looking around the world in the late 1970s might have noticed, about the way different economies were
developing, take a look at this chart again, which
I've carried forward to 1976. Now I'm not saying that the Chinese
leadership had access to this particular chart, but I think they broadly sensed the
facts that this chart is depicting. If you were to look at this chart, you might say to yourself, well, the
United States model, that's just too remote from our
experience, that's not interesting. And ask yourself, which would be the
models the Chinese government would be most
likely to notice? And the answers, of course, would be the
models closest to them, literally. Models in places like Japan, Taiwan, South
Korea. And take a look at what happened with
Japan. By the mid-1970s, it's just evident that
the Japanese are doing something pretty potent in the way
they're organizing their economy. Taiwan, by the way, is following a
relatively similar trajectory by the middle of the
1970s. And take a look at South Korea. The 1960s begins to see a takeoff of the
South Korean economy that hadn't fully ripened yet, but was already
evident by the middle of the 1970s. So that faction of Chinese leaders, that
might have seemed appealing to them. By the way, they would have looked at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea in the middle of the 1970s, and would have seen a
nominal democracy in Japan, in which one party had won all the elections,
a nominal democracy in Taiwan that really looked like an authoritarian state, as of
the mid-ï¿½70s, and a nominal democracy in South Korea that also masked kind of an authoritarian
state, again, as you would've looked at this in
the mid-1970s. So from their perspective, those models in
those countries might have been pretty tempting
to them. As became increasingly evident by the
early 1980s, China was taking a new direction, actually formally normalizing relations
with the United States in 1978 and 1979. You see, here's Time Magazine letting the
American people know that this man, Deng Xiaoping, is
banishing Mao's ghost. Deng Xiaoping was famous for his
pragmatism. The saying universally attributed to him
among Chinese is that: I don't care if the cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice. But another aspect of Deng's pragmatism
was to preserve the firm, clear, dictatorial authority of
the central government. So he pushes the liberals aside, and he
begins what historians think of as a Fang-Shou cycle: Fang, loosening; Shou,
tightening. You loosen things up, they then seem to be
getting a little bit out of hand, then the conservatives react, you tighten
them up again, and then, no, you don't want to go too far
that way. Loosen some more. So this constant experimentation of trying
out this, trying out this, and then stepping
back. And that cycle continues all through the
1980s. But what's clear to the whole world is that China is making a fundamental change
in direction. To understand the way global capitalism
changed in the 1970s and 1980s, I think it's helpful to
understand an impossibility theorem. This is an idea I'm adapting and borrowing
a little from the Canadian economist, a Nobel Prize
winner, named Robert Mundell. Mundell posited a kind of trilemma, in
which you can have three goals that you can posit, but you
can actually only achieve two of these three goals in any
financial system you design. For example, the three goals are: 1) capital mobility, that means the ability to easily
move large sums of money across borders,
billions, maybe even trillions of dollars moving
between banks. That's capital mobility, easy movement of
private investment. Second, stable exchange rates between
currencies. Third, monetary independence, financial
independence. So for example, in the old gold standard
system of the late 1800s and early 1900s, the gold
exchange standard, capital mobility was great,
exchange rates extremely stable, monetary independence
very little, because the hydraulics of the gold
standard meant that if a lot of gold effectively moved to one
country from another country, if you didn't have enough gold,
you were forced to change your interest rates to attract some
of that gold back. That meant that you were highly interdependent on what other people were
doing. If other people were attracting gold, you
had to change your policies. You were not entirely independent in guiding your own economy. So now let's contrast that old gold
exchange standard system with the Bretton Woods solution that was
created at the end of World War II.
Remember, under the gold exchange standard, from the 1870s to the early 1900s, capital
mobility high, exchange rates very stable, monetary independence,
national independence, low. This is one of the reasons people
complained about, kind of, the bankers really being in charge. Instead, after the Great Depression, and
under the Bretton Woods System, capital mobility low, very much controlled by
governments. Exchange rates, pretty stable.
National independence, national autonomy to run their own economies the
way the governments wanted, high. So that's the Bretton Woods System. But by the early 1970s, the Bretton Woods
System had collapsed. All right then, what could take its place? One idea being put forward in the early 1970s and getting increasing strength all
through the decade, it's actually to go back to
something that looked more like the gold exchange
standard. That is, you could try to go back to a
system in which money could move freely, lots of
foreign investment, but also money could easily leave countries, in
which money felt it wasn't popular. Relatively stable exchange rates.
But what do you give up there? Just as under the old gold standard
system, you give up national independence. That is the money was free to leave, the governments couldn't hold that money
there, therefore, governments had to change their policies in order to
attract the money and the people who had the
money. You can see then, these are very important political choices you're making. They're not just driven by immutable
economic forces. And by the way, another problem if you
wanted to do that is: If you don't want to go
back to a gold exchange standard in a world of paper money, in other words, a world of
paper money, how do you do this? The solution to that problem becomes a
kind of capitalist revolution in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Remember, think in the 1970s,
there are really two great establishments for national economic thinking.
One I call here National Keynesianism. That meant that national government, the
nation state, should be able to use either fiscal policy, taxing or spending, or
monetary policy, interest rates, the printing of
money, to change its macroeconomic situation.
You don't like your inflation rate, you don't like your unemployment rate, the national government needs the autonomy
to fix that through its policies, as the autonomous decision
maker, very much a Bretton Woods model. Another establishment would be import-
substitution industrialization; the export-oriented industrialists are another branch of National Keynesianism. Import-substitution industrialization is a
different family of ideas, but also again, even more keyed to the power of the
nation state. So national economic autonomy is huge for
these establishments. So the revolution then was challenging
those establishments. If you go back to an idea, in which
national independence goes down in order to free money to move easily from one border to another, you undermine both
of these establishments. And instead, you increase the power of the
people who hold the movable money. In effect, you create a constant global
election, in which countries are competing for
mobile capital. In other words, for the votes of
investors, investors who loan the governments money in the form of
buying their bonds, or who loan their companies money, buying
their corporate bonds, or buying stock in their
companies. Or who make portfolio investments,
investing in or building up infrastructure, bridges, new
factories, and so on. The assault on the establishment begins
really in the United States in early 1970s, with people like the then Treasury
Secretary George Shultz and others, very influenced
by the liberal economic thinking of people
like Milton Friedman, Hayek, and others. Their argument is that the money should be
free to move. It's a much more liberal approach in the
classical sense. Get the government out of the way. Let the money move. These American views do not prevail in the
early ï¿½70s, but they're influential. They're most influential with the German
liberals in the middle of the 1970s. These ideas are picked up not only by Germans, but also by Frenchmen,
Englishmen, who begin moving toward management of
their currencies in ways that will support this new liberal
economic vision. And by the end of the 1970s, those
European ideas have a huge effect coming back to
America again. The Americans are fighting a terrible inflation and unemployment problem. And in effect, the European central
bankers are saying to the Americans, you need to follow our lead, and let's coordinate
in the way we manage our money supplies. In a way, the problem they're trying to
solve is this: How do you have a gold standard like
system but with paper money that governments print?
How to make paper money hard? The way to do that is by managing how much
of the paper money you issue, and then coordinating the management of that
between a few key governments that supply the reserve
currencies for global exchange. That means tight monetary controls coordinated by US, European central bankers, Japanese central bankers. And that's the system that emerges in the
late 1970s and 1980s, they all agree to have firmer
control of their money supplies. The result, then, is to create a world
emerging in the 1980s, in which capital mobility gets
higher and higher. National independence, the ability of one
nation to chart its own path as to how it's going to manage its
economy gets less and less. And exchange rates go from being really
erratic as Bretton Woods collapses to not being fixed, because it's
not a true gold system, but the instability of exchange rates
persistently narrows. So here's a chart showing the exchange rate between the dollar and
the German currency. Back then, Germany had its own currency,
the deutschemark. Bretton Woods System, you see, very, very
stable. Bretton Woods collapses, exchange rates
start fluctuating all over the place. Slowly as the central banks coordinate
more and more, that instability just very gradually goes down
from sort of here, just moving in that general direction,
gradually narrowing. And we can see a similar phenomenon in the
change in the exchange rate of the dollar and the
Japanese yen. Bretton Woods system, really stable. Bretton Woods breaks down, see the
fluctuations beginning. And they stay pretty significant into the
1980s and then during the 1980s, you can see that the
instability is getting a little better. What's happening here is that the central
banks are more and more harmonizing the way they handled
their monetary policies. More and more trying to make their paper
Money, money created by government fiat, into hard
money with very stable value that will then attract international investment
and facilitate a lot of movement of money. But in adopting this approach, there are some significant tradeoffs. Because, for example, to tighten the money
supply in effect means you've got to raise
interest rates. You've got to raise the cost of the money
in order to ring a lot of that extra money out of
the system. That's what Time Magazine is noticing
here, when the United States decisively joins
this regime, in 1979, to curb its persistent, double-digit inflation, under the
leadership of this man, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker, at the end of the
Carter administration. And you can see the way they're
characterizing the problem, which pushes the United States into a sharp
recession in the early 1980s. But by the mid-1980s, the benefits of the
new system are becoming evident. Remember that Great Inflation of the 1970s we talked about earlier? That's been pretty well wrung out of the
system by the late 1980s. The new system is freeing up enormous
flows of capital investment. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs, for
the first time in the late 1980s, are not only opening up kind of branch operations
that help people do deals in the United States, they're becoming truly multinational
investment banks, where someone from Goldman Sachs can put
together a financial deal involving Germans on both
sides of the transaction. And someone from Deutsche Bank, in New York,
might be putting together financial deals with Americans on
both sides of the transaction. Billions and billions, then trillions of
dollars begins moving rapidly across borders, fueling economic growth.
But you can see that this financial politics, which sounds kind of technical
and seems boring to a lot of people, involves immensely
important tradeoffs because all kinds of effects that touch
every sort of business, in the United States, Europe, Japan, and
then in the wider world. And it's rooted, as you can see, in basic
political choices as to, in effect, who's going to be in charge of
driving the economic policies of these key countries? You can see the tradeoffs that were made
in the ï¿½70s and ï¿½80s, and these tradeoffs manifest
themselves in a couple of kinds of crises. First, there's a crisis for the worldï¿½s
borrowers. All of a sudden, the interest rates on
their loans are going way, way up. If you are a big debtor, like many
countries in the Third World were, borrowing money to pay for the imports because they don't have enough money to
pay for the imports of, say, price of your
oil because their own export industries are so
weak, all of a sudden, their loans are now much
costlier to roll over. Then what happens is they're getting ready
to go bust. So there are lots of debt crises all over
the Third World in the early 1980s. That's one sort of crisis, and by the way, those debt issues turn out to
be a big problem for the socialist countries
in the late 1980s. But there's another kind of crisis. What if you're living in a developed
country, like say, France, and you don't want to be the prisoner of international bankers and
international investors? You want national independence to drive
your economy the way you want. Indeed, even to have state ownership of the key
banks in order to hand out money and credit the way you think
your country wants it handed out. It was just that kind of crisis that
France faced in the early 1980s, when Francois Mitterrand took power with
his Socialist Party, in partnership with the
sommunists. And a key to understanding what happened in
France in early 1980s actually has a lot to do with
this man: His name is Jacques Delors. Here's a picture of Delors in the late
1980s. Delors, a little later on, as a European
statesman. In a way, Delors is playing the kind of
role in the 1980s that Jean Monnet was playing in the 1950s.
He's a visionary for European economic integration, and Delors's concept is the
Europeans need to harmonize their economies. But see, that means Delors very much
supports the kind of vision that's developed in the ï¿½70s and ï¿½80s of interdependence, of harmonizing
economic policies, especially between the French and the
Germans, who've adopted this liberal, hard money approach to their
economic policy. You can't have European economic
integration unless it starts with harmonizing the French and German
economic policies. So Mitterrand's government faces a choice: pursue the independent path that some of
the socialist and communist want or pursue the interdependent path,
marching in step with the Germans, advocated by people like
Delors. And Delors, who's an influential figure in
within Mitterrand's government, wins that argument
and helps France lead the way toward the new era of European economic integration in the middle and
late 1980s. Indeed by 1990, you can see Britain resenting these new ideas for European
integration. This conservative newspaper, The Sun, has a
pretty self-evident headline. What are they talking about here? Sun readers are urged to tell the French
fool where to stuff his ECU. ECU, that's an acronym for European
Currency Unit, a step towards integrating European
currencies, giving up, from the point of view of that British newspaper, the national
independence Britain should prize. But that is part of Delors's philosophy. He believes that Europe working together
will have a stronger economy, a prosperous
Western Europe. And by the way, the apparent success of
his vision, by the end of the 1980s, will turn out to be a huge magnet for European countries to
the East. So, let's just pause for a moment and see
how some of these ideas we've laid on the
table come together. Big choice: Should the developed countries
retain true independence in the management of their economies or
should they accept interdependence? If you'll remember, that was also a huge
issue back in the 1920s and 1930s. And you'll remember that in 1930s, governments chose independence as the way
they wanted to go. And national rivalries and imperial
rivalries deepened into dreadful things. In the ï¿½70s and ï¿½80s, they're accepting
interdependence as what they see as the path to their
prosperity. But that also entails some really
important sacrifices and a diminution in the central role of the nation state. Another big issue we've seen in this
presentation and the last one is how to you present
yourself. Are you just the managerial state, in
which the socialist are just another version of the
managerial state? Are you essentially equivalent forms of
government? Or is there something vitally different
about your form of government? And in the ï¿½70s and ï¿½80s, in different ways, the United States, Western Europe, and
even to a lesser extent, China are asserting that they are vitally different
from the countries in the Socialist Bloc. But there's a tradeoff when you assert
that difference. Do you value conciliation between the two blocs or are you willing to accept
confrontation? Because the assertion of these differences
is going to exacerbate tensions, and we saw how that played out in the
early 1980s. After an intense period of polarization,
confrontation, it subsides with some domestic and
international momentum, at least at the time, appearing to favor the Western European and American side in 1984
and 1985. And that's the period in which the Soviet
Union, and other countries in the Socialist Bloc, are engaging in new
thinking of their own. We'll learn more about that new thinking
when we talk again. See you then.
