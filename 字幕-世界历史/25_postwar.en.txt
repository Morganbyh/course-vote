Hi, welcome back. Make yourself comfortable, and let's talk
about the way new nations were recreating themselves in the early postwar era, what
the conflicts were about. Let's look at Europe first of all, to see
what the situation was there. You can remember we talked about the way
Germany was divided up into these different zones
of military occupation. Again, no German Democratic Republic yet, no Federal Republic of Germany yet. These are just the different zones
occupied by the different armies. If you looked over in Eastern Europe, the
Soviet Union moved west, annexing these new republics into
the Soviet Union, liquidating the Baltic Republics that had
been created after World War I and that had been annexed in
1940, captured by the Germans, recaptured again.
Poland used to occupy this area here. Now Poland's been moved west. All this area in brown used to be part of
Germany. The Germans, mainly uprooted, have fled
westward in the millions as refugees, from here and also from the German-speaking
portions of the new Czechoslovak Republic. Soviet troops or allied communists parties are in power or
playing a key role in all of these places. In Asia, look at the situation in China at
the end of World War II. The Nationalist government holds these
areas in white. The capital of Nationalist China had been
Here, at Nanjing. But they had had to move their capital
during the war all the way from here to here. Communist guerrilla fighters have some
areas they're fighting in all through here. What happens then is, when the Japanese
leave, see all this pink area, especially here in
Manchuria, the Japanese troops move out as prisoners. Who fills the void? And the initial fighting, the initial
struggle to fill that vacuum was especially acute in ï¿½45 and
ï¿½46 here in Manchuria. Here's a standard map of the world any school child would've had in their book in
1948. Just to notice some areas of the world we haven't
talked about recently, we can zoom in a little bit on Africa over
here. And in 1948, you'd see still a lot of
colonies here. France, Algeria, French West Africa,
French Equatorial Africa, Belgian Congo, and so
on. Portuguese Angola. Not much changed there --
yet. Over in South America, also not much
changed from the countries that had established
during the 1800s. These continents mainly staying out of
World War II. But an incredibly dynamic area right
here in Southeast Asia. Let's take a closer look at Southeast
Asia. The Japanese had pushed the French out of
Indochina, had pushed the British out of Burma and out of the Malay States
and Singapore, their great base, here. They'd pushed the Dutch out of the Dutch East Indies and occupied the
Philippines. As the Japanese, in turn, returned home as prisoners, a vacuum exists
and there's a contest as to who will regain
control. The French are trying to reclaim their
position in French Indo-China. The Americans were ambivalent, the French
find themselves soon locked into warfare against a Viet Minh resistance that's increasingly receiving some
communist support. In Burma, more civil conflict, now between the
British who wish to reclaim their position there and
Burmese independence fighters. Similar problems are brewing in the Malay
States. In the Dutch East Indies, an independence
movement is contesting the Dutch efforts to regain control of
their old colony. In the Philippines in 1946, the Americans
grant independence to the new Republic of the Philippines, but they then face a guerrilla movement,
trying to take away control, called the Huks, H-U-K, that eventually will also be
intrigued by the communist example, too. So, Southeast Asia is all in turmoil, even
as civil war is reigniting in China. Now let's take a look at what happened in
India. You'll remember from past presentations
that the British themselves have been deeply
divided about what to do about India, especially
since the beginning of the 1930s. The war had intensified all that and,
finally, during the war, the British decided, especially to keep the
Indians fighting on their side, that they would promise to give India self
government when the war was over. The Indians then demanded the British make good on that promise.
Complicated negotiations ensued. The same issues that had been there for 20 years: What should an Indian state look
like? How do you reconcile the different divisions between princely rulers and
democratic rulers? Muslims and Hindus? Finally, the British, in effect, threw up
their hands and suddenly quit in 1947 and left the country pretty precipitously,
resulting in the violent partition of the country that you see
portrayed on this map, where heavily Muslim parts of India, in
effect, created themselves as a new state called Pakistan with all kinds of
exchanges of population, millions of lives lost, re-settlements of
people on both sides of these lines. This great princely state retaining a
degree of autonomy, Hyderabad, until it was finally annexed by the state of
India in 1948, with continuing disagreements lingering on
the borders of the new Indian state with China and over what should happen to the distant
and lightly populated realm of Tibet. If we switch our focus now to the Near
East, the postwar period was pretty turbulent
there, too. This map just gives a sense of the scope
of the British role in the Middle East: direct mandatory rule in places like
Palestine and Trans-Jordan; a British military alliance and a kind of
protectorate with the local rulers in Iraq and in Egypt;
British military occupation in places like former Italian colonies of
Libya, Eritrea, and Somalia. But a real focal point of attention in 1945-46 was: What should happen in
Iran? Let's take a closer look at that one. In Iran, the Russians had occupied the
northern part of the country. The British and Americans had occupied the
southern half of the country during World War II. They were fearful that a government allied
with the Nazis would take control here and cut off their ability to get supplies through Iran to the Soviet Union during
the war. Well, when the war was over, the military
forces of all sides had promised to leave. The British and American military forces were pulling out, with the British
maintaining extremely valuable concessions to get the
oil out of this part of Iran. The Russians, however, were slow to leave,
they didn't want to pull their troops out, creating
spheres of influence and groups of allied supporters
up in the northern part of Iran and seeking oil
concessions here, too. Finally, a sharp crisis between Russia and the United States led
to demands that the Russians keep their promise and pull
their troops out of Northern Iran, which, finally in 1946, the Russians agreed
to do. But it was one of the other things that
contributed to a sense of rising tensions between East
and West. And that little story about Iran is a good
introduction to the big question of: What are the origins
of what we now call the Cold War, the struggle between
anti-communists and communists? Now, as you've seen in this class, my
argument is that's actually a much older struggle that's been going on for generations before the end of World War II. But commonly, historians tend to talk
about the Cold War, as we know it today, arising after World War II, which
is one part of this longer struggle. So you can have big ideas about the
origins of the Cold War, the structural clash of these two systems, but I think
it's useful to boil this down just to the dilemmas of people like you and me, just trying to solve particular problems
that they're seeing on the ground, like what are we
going to do about the situation in Iran? What are the options there? You've got a situation you're looking at,
in Germany where we're trying to run this place together,
in China, where the different sides we support are already
embroiled in a civil war. What are our options for what to do about
that? What are the solutions that we come up
with? No one tried harder at sorting these
things out in good faith than the American general, now made
special envoy, George Marshall. Few figures had greater political prestige at the end of World War II than General
Marshall did. [LAUGH] And he was soon given some of the
most difficult tasks out there. First to try to sort out the problem in
China, and second to try to sort out the problems
with Germany. He first tried in China, in 1946. Here's Marshall meeting with the leaders
of the two sides, the Nationalist
representative on the left of your screen and on the right
of your screen the representative of the Chinese Communists, Zhou Enlai.
The Marshall situation was pretty tough. The Americans had a long association and sympathy with the Nationalist government
in China. They're trying to help the Nationalist
troops relocate and fill the vacuum left by the departing
Japanese occupiers. And actually the Soviet government also
had decent relations with the Nationalist government that it thought
would probably keep power. But the Soviets were also divided helping
their Communist friends try to get a firm foothold in Manchuria as well,
a lot of tension there. Civil war clearly returning. Marshall then tries to see if the two
sides will agree to share power somehow, in some
combined government, tries to work on the terms of how they can
share power together. He brings them together, he tries pretty
hard in a reasonably good faith.
And finally concludes it won't work. He ends up kind of blaming both sides.
Neither side really wants to share power. Both sides see this as a zero sum game
that only one of them can win. But Marshall also comes away, and this is
important, with a pretty negative image of the Nationalist
government and its prospects, a government that he increasingly views as corrupt and riddled with some pretty fundamental
problems. Though at that time, 1946, both the
American and Soviet governments thought the Nationalist
government was going to control the game. By the end of 1946, the Americans are
looking at a situation: China, torn by turmoil. Germany, they can't agree on
how to administer the country together. The Germans are moving to the edge of
starvation. They've got to figure out some way of organizing this economy, to get
something going, or else they'll either have to subsidize
food for all the Germans in a situation where
some of the Allied powers, like the British and
French, are themselves broke and having trouble
feeding their own people. What to do? The Americans feel like they're on the
defensive. The basic administration of these places is breaking
down. And who's going to benefit from chaos? The communists. How is the United States going to regain
its strategic initiative here? How do they drive the action? Well Marshall's next effort is to bring
some ideas to a conference in Moscow in early
1947, where he's going to try to work out an agreed way to manage the future of
Germany. This is an important foreign ministers meeting. Here's Marshall talking with this man, the
French foreign minister, and this man, Ernest Bevin, the foreign
minister of Great Britain. The French don't want to do much to let
the Germans up, but they also don't want to antagonize
the Americans. The British have already concluded that
this whole effort to try to get some agreed way to run Germany is
a hopeless venture, that what Marshall is trying to do is bound to fail, but
Marshall's giving it a hard try. He's engaged in intense discussions with
this man, the Soviet Foreign Minister,
Vyacheslav Molotov. The negotiations in Moscow fail. When you get into the details of this,
and I've written a little bit about this, the details are interesting: Marshall
tried hard on how to disarm Germany for at least 25 years, with multinational
forces that would police the place. He's got a proposal on the table for that. He actually has a fairly creative set of
proposals that he puts on the table to handle the most
difficult economic issues, which are extremely complex, having to do with balancing the payments Germany's
going to make to the Soviet Union as reparations, with what
you then do to restart the German economy. He doesn't have much help from his allies,
who think this is unlikely to work, but the Soviets are really unresponsive to
Marshall's initiatives, too. He has doubters of his ideas even inside
his own government. He leaves Moscow in failure. It's not going to work. Marshall comes away from his final meeting
with Stalin believing that the Soviets are
content to just fold their arms, watch Germany
collapse into starving chaos, and reap the benefits from
that disorder. From Marshall's point of view, that's not good
enough, he needs something else. He returns from Moscow, goes to the
American people, gives a nationwide radio address
in which he tells the American people, in April 1947,
that the patient is dying while the doctors are
deliberating. He has to think of some other way in which the United States can recapture
the strategic initiative in a world that seems to be
disintegrating. We'll find out what he came up with next
time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
