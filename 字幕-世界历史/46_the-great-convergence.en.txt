[BLANK_AUDIO] Hi, welcome back. This time I want to talk about the Great
Convergence. The Great Convergence, you remember at the
beginning of the course we talked about the Great
Divergence? Now we're seeing the opposite trend
occurring in the first decades of the 21st century. It had really been building since 1950. All through the 20th century, the
dissemination of public health improvements, vaccines, are beginning to
raise life expectancy. But one of the striking things since 1950,
and especially since 1990, is increasing improvements in the material
well being of people around the world. What I call here the rise of the rest. Let's study that a little more carefully. For instance, if we look at the global
middle-class, middle-class consumption, let's take a
look at this chart. Spend some time with this. So in 2000, this chart would tell you that
if you just looked at the share of middle-class consumption
that's coming from Europe, the United States, and Japan. Thatï¿½s this vicinity right in here. So you can see if that's 10% and that's
80%, that's something like 70%, more than two
thirds of all middle-class consumption in the world, was coming from
Europe, the United States, and Japan. You can see this beginning to change
already. Here we are in 2013, so that share would
now be about this much. Let's say, oh, something on the order of
60%, where it had been 70% in 2000. But look where it might be, say, only ten
years from now. Let's suppose you were to pick 2023 as
your benchmark reference point. That's only about this much.
How much is that? Oh, something like between 40 and maybe
78%. So now figure 38%.
Just notice nearly 70% here in 2000. By 2023, 10 years from now, that
proportion is down to about 38%, and you can see how it's
narrowing. Why is it narrowing?
What are the big contributors? Other Asia, significant but that's
relatively constant. The big changes, of course, are occurring
from the role of India and China in bringing people into the global
middle-class. Here in 2013, that's the share of India
and China. Ten years from now, that's the share of
India and China. And you can see how that's going to
continue to rise. Now, that has some negative implications
for global energy consumption, the consumption
of raw materials, but just in terms of material well-being, clearly some kind of
convergence is occurring. Here's another measure of it. This is also from, the National
Intelligence Council. The National Intelligence Council, by the
way, is a part of the United States intelligence
community. This is a public document that they
produce called Global Trends 2030. It's a very interesting report. This chart, which is also in that report, talks about the shares of ownership in
financial assets. That is, kind of, who owns the world's stocks and
bonds, things like that. Well, if you were to look at the year
2000, the United States, Western Europe, and Japan own something like 87% of the
world's financial assets. Now, we're close to 2010, that 87% has gone down to 70%.
And by 2020, only seven years from now, that's scheduled to go
down, that's predicted to go down to 55%. 87% to 55% proportion of ownership of
financial assets in the world. That's a pretty startling change just in
the space of 20 years. You can see where the trend lines are going.
And by the way, some of that is China. You can see the Chinese numbers here: 10,
17. But also other emerging countries, 11, 19,
are playing their part in this.
Here's another sort of measurement. The National Intelligence Council
reprinted a multi-component global power index. I think this power index is actually
somewhat bogus. It crudely expresses a combination of
population, economic growth, per capita income, some military
factors to try to create an index of proportion relative to
the rest of the world. It kind of captures a little bit of crude
zeitgeist, kind of what people feel like, just as
they look around the world, who seems to be more
prosperous or stronger. And of course, in this forecast, you see
the rise of China from a place of a little more than 10%
in their index around now to a situation where that number would go
up to about 18% by 2050. The United States about 24% now, going
down to about 16% by 2050, and so on. This isn't so much that these countries
are getting poorer or weaker in an absolute
sense. These are relative measurements
as proportions of global power: India rising, Japan diminishing in relative terms, Russia relatively
constant. Alright. Now, I've thrown a lot of facts at you.
Why is this happening? Well, now let's think way back to the
early part of the course in Weeks Two, Three, Four. We were talking about the Great
Divergence. Let's recall: Why did the Great Divergence
happen in the first place? Well there are a number of factors we
brought out. One of them was that, the developed world
had more access to global resources. They were using the world's oceans and
complex trading network. They were building their fiscal military states to leverage resources especially
from the Atlantic world. We noticed that because of the Commercial
Revolution and the Military Revolution, opportunities or
problems were arising for them. But then because of the way they were
solving those problems, they were creating new financial
institutions, new military institutions like navies and other things, and then that found
them in a position of relative strength because of the way
they had solved these problems. They had built institutions, for instance,
like universities, which were exchanging knowledge at a very rapid
rate, so that innovations in Italy, or discoveries in Denmark could be
transmitted immediately to scientists in London, who in turn would make discoveries that would
be read about in Paris. So you get these cumulative effects that
also express itself in a culture of scientific innovation. And then we also saw how once you have
certain advantages, letï¿½s say a naval power or access to resources or in building
these institutions, that then gave you more
opportunities, more solutions, and the advantages would begin to
accumulate one upon another. So that the divergence would become really
quite wide, as we saw during the 1800s. So if those were just some of the things
we talked about when we were analyzing the Great Divergence, what then are the
equalizers that are changing that situation in the
21st century? First, finance. Emerging markets, less developed countries
have access to a lot of money. The Chinese, for example, have enormous
resources that they can use in buying the things that they
want. Buying resources, technology. Because they have access to finance,
either their own cash reserves or a strong ability to borrow money,
leveraging against future earnings, they have
financial clout. They can buy the things that they need. The developed countries no longer have
disproportionately good access to, say, coal or other raw materials that they
might need. When I talk about equalized access to raw
materials, one point about a globalized world is that raw materials
available anywhere are available to anyone with funds and access
to funds is also globalized, and that means that a lot of the world has
comparative advantages. Another sort of raw material are just
people. When economists analyze the productivity
of a country, the first factor they start with is labor supply.
How many people are available to produce? So this is an interesting chart, also from
the National Intelligence Council's Global Trends book, that talks
about demographic windows of opportunity, you see what they explain over here on the
left. That means basically the proportion of people in prime, productive ages, not
too many children and not too many old people who
are dependents on social welfare. That is, the ideal demographic window has
a proportion of seniors less than 15% and the proportion of
children is less than 30%. So from that point of view, you look at
this chart and it's says whose demographic positions at
the moment are ideal. Probably the least good demographic
positions at the moment are Germany and the United
Kingdom. The United States is still in its demographic
window of opportunity, but that window, according to this chart,
is getting ready to close. Now, one advantage the United States has historically had is its ability to bring
in more people through immigration where the
opportunities are there. Japan, which historically has not been as
open to outside immigration, their window is
also closing. The Russian window is also closing,
according to this chart. And a lot of the people that are being
picked up in this chart are Muslims in Central Asia who are not in the most productive portions of the Russian
population yet. One interesting point about this chart is
that Chinese demography, because the Chinese have been constraining family
size for more than 40 years, as a result, China is in an irreversible demographic trend where it's going to have
difficulty finding enough young people and there are genuine labor shortages that
have already cropped up in China, and this chart captures a little bit of that,
though they're still in a very strong demographic
window. The ideal demographies, from the point of
view of this chart, are in countries like Iran,
India, Brazil. Those are also important factors. Of course, having people is just not
enough. It helps if your people are educated. And one of the important equalizers is access to education, the building of
primary schools. Remember that the creation of public
schools, public education, that's a very modern
development. Public schools, as we know them today, begin getting
created in the United States and Europe in the
1800s, in the United States, on a large scale,
1830s, 1840s. Public education doesn't become pretty
universal, even in England, until towards the end of the
1800s. That's spread now through much of the
world. Everywhere, governments are building
primary schools, and the results, especially in recent decades, are
pretty striking. And the most crude measure of education
is: Can people read? Let's looks at world illiteracy rates. In 1970, total illiteracy rates worldwide
is about, oh, 36%. 36% of the population of the world cannot
read. This is women, men. Because of traditional societies and the
persistence of the traditional ways of life,
illiteracy among women always tends to run higher in less developed countries than is the case for
men. But in 1970, total illiteracy
Rate: 36% worldwide. Look at where we are, virtually today, in
2015: 36% to 15%. That's a really dramatic change in one
generation. And the divergence between male and female
illiteracy, 45 to 28 here. 17 point divergence. That divergence here is more like 19
verses 11. It's only an 8 point divergence.
It's narrowing, also a significant trend. Let's spend a little more time talking
about this issue of opportunities for women. One of the significant advantages of
Europe, the United States, and Japan has been that they use their women
more. Their women starting getting public
education in the 1800s and early 1900s. In the early 1900s, there's more female
participation in the work force, more female participation
in public life. That's half your population. If you're not going to
educate half your population, if you're not going to
use half your population in the workforce, the
fundamental productive power of your society is just going to be
dramatically limited. If women are educated, if they have more opportunities to participate, they begin
to produce more. They become more active participants. It changes the prospects for society as a
whole. So, as opportunities for women are
growing, the gap also begins to narrow between, so to speak, the West, including countries
like Japan and others, and the rest. This is still a persistent problem in some
traditional societies. It is a very serious problem in the Muslim world, and in parts of the Hindu world, in
India, where woman are not being given similar opportunities because of the
persistence of traditional beliefs about the roles of
women. That's a choice people make. It's not my position as a historian to condemn those traditional beliefs or even
to judge them. It is my position as a historian to call attention to the consequences of these
traditional patterns and what that does for the economic prospects
of those societies. Another key equalizer that helps us
explain the Great Convergence is the globalization of manufacturing
capability. If you have this image of, say, Europe or
the United States in the middle of the 1800s, they have all
these large factories and mills. They have the capability to build these
huge factories and folks in the less developed world and the colonies,
they're just producing commodities, mines,
plantations, raw materials. They're further down the value chain. Well, that's not the case in the 21st
century. Manufacturing capability, the ability to construct very high
technology industries, well that's now universal, high technology factories in China, for
instance. The manufacturing of my Apple technology,
my iPhone, well that's done in China. So, high technology manufacturing
capability available everywhere. But not just that, I called attention to organizations, organizational
capability in this course. You remember in the late 1800s, how much
stress I laid on the rise of the firm, the rise of modern corporations, and the
administrative capability that gave to those
organizations for economic performance. It's the spread of modern corporate
organizations to other countries, to less developed countries, that also allows
them to narrow the gap. Now, one key factor, and one limiting
feature, is, and it's not on this slide, you have to have a strong legal system. If you want this organizational
capability, that means you have to have a company, you have to be able to
protect investments in the company. You have to have good legal management of the company, its property rights, and the
rest. And the balance between that company's
rights and the rest of the citizens because otherwise that can
create an unstable situation. If you have a strong legal system, this organizational capability is
greatly enhanced. And the countries that have the best
prospects to narrow the gap not only have technology
and organizational capability, but also have highly functional legal
systems to go with them. Finally, another great equalizer are
markets. For instance, the reason that China and India have decent growth prospects is not
because they will be able to export even more
cheap stuff for sale in the United States. Their real prospects depend on their
ability to serve a growing market of middle class consumers
in their own countries. They too have access to those markets. They too can produce high value goods for
Chinese consumers, and Indian companies should in principal
be able to produce high value goods for Indian
consumers, as part of a global trading network in which everybody can sell to everybody.
That becomes a set of equalizers. Now, I'm putting a positive spin on some
of this. It's not hard for some of you sitting out
there to think of the negative sides of some of
these globalizing developments too. Constant disruption. The constant creative destruction, as
Joseph Schumpeter put it, of modern capitalism is bound to create problems in a lot of
different countries. There will occasionally be winners and
losers in different sectors and in different
places. That's the tradeoff that goes with this
kind of dynamic economic picture. If you don't like that side of the
tradeoff, you can push back against it. Try to confine globalization. We saw experiments along those lines in
the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. But those experiments ran into a lot of trouble in the latter part of the 20th
century. So is the globalized world then just
inevitable? Bound to happen? I don't think so. It seems that way sometimes, but it's
really worth calling attention to the political enablers that
allow this to happen. This is not just passive economic forces
at work. One reason this can happen is because
there are a variety of regional hubs that are critical to the operation of this
system, in Japan, China, Europe, North America,
Brazil, perhaps. The political stability and openness to
commerce of all of those regional hubs is a political fact, not to
be taken for granted, because we've seen times, in the not too distant
past, when this factor was not in place. Another key political enabler is the free
movement of money. Youï¿½ll remember in these presentations, we've talked about the evolution of global
money: Generally, a free movement of money in the late 1800's built around the gold
standard. How that then collapsed. Then, a different kind of global monetary
standard was created, at least for the non-communist world, in the
aftermath of World War II. That, that then collapsed. And then in the late 1970s and early 1980s, another kind of global money
evolved, one really based on the coordination
between a few key reserve currencies that were
generally convertible. But, that's not just a passive economic
force. That's done by central banks, it's done by
governments. It's done by governments that have
consciously chosen certain kinds of economic tradeoffs, which I described,
that occurred 30 years ago, where they chose to allow the free
movement of money at the cost of national independence, to
some degree, in setting their economic policies.
A third kind of political enabler that
allows this world we're describing is the effective
disappearance of interstate wars. This is really worth reflecting about. Because if you study world history, it
seems like the one eternal verity is that there are going to be wars between countries, wars between kingdoms, wars
between states. We certainly have seen a lot of them, but
really since about the beginning of the 1990s, they
have almost completely disappeared. You have an American led invasion of Iraq in early 2003,
a few examples here and there, some interstate activity in Central Africa
around the Great Lakes region, but in general, interstate wars are gone. Not disappeared, but almost completely
gone. That obviously is a political enabler that
allows for the kind of convergence that we're
seeing here. Related to that are safe seas. Again, you may take it for granted that
merchant ships can freely traverse the world's oceans without
interference until you don't have it. I mean, really the main hindrances to safe
seas in the world today are criminal gangs,
pirates, operating say off the coast of East Africa and a little bit off the coast of West Africa,
and different countries are mounting naval
patrols to try to contain that danger. That's really the sole threat to safe seas
today. That parallels the extraordinary situation
during the 1800s, when partly thanks to the predominance of
the Royal Navy, even though there were
interstate wars going on, the seas remained safe for world
trade. Then that gets interrupted a lot in the
first half of the 20th century, but really since about 1945, safe seas. And with that, we have a relatively open
trading system. Again, this open trading system we have
in the world today is a relatively recent
innovation. An open trading system in the
non-communist world is very much a post-World War II creation; an open
trading system of global scope, represented by the World Trade
Organization, WTO, that China joined in 2002, that's a relatively recent innovation. Obviously, a political choice that
countries are making. Now let me go through some more concrete
illustrations. Here for example, is the situation in
China. You remember how in the 1840s, 50s, and 1860s, China was broken open to
foreign trade? Well, when the communists took over in
China, they successfully closed it off again to foreign trade
beginning in 1949. Here now is a map that shows China opening up again to foreign trade in the 1980s and
1990s. But this time, it's not foreign gunboats
steaming their way up the Yangtze River. This time it's the Chinese government
making a conscious decision, beginning in the south, here, then
expanding along the coast, to open up the same sort of network of
ports that were once opened up more forcibly in
the middle of the 1800s, now being opened up
peacefully to foreign trade. And in the 1990s, you see those openings
spreading all throughout the Chinese interior. Of course, obviously the effects for China
have been very significant. China has been an enormous recipient of foreign investment, of foreign
interactions. It's fueled a huge export-oriented
industrialization in China that's been really good for Chinese economic
growth for about the last 25 years. It's worth also noting, though, the
significant role that Japan played in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The significance of the Japanese hub for trade around its part
of the Pacific Rim in South Korea, China, Hong Kong, and
others. Notice the scale of Japanese direct
investment, measured in billions of dollars, even in
1996. More than eight billion dollars in China. More money in Hong Kong from Japanese
investors than all of China put together by 1996. And even more money than that in Thailand.
Notice Singapore, alone, more than $11 billion in Japanese investment.
Notice the scale of the investment in Indonesia. So you can see the significance of Japan
as an economic engine, not just important for China and South
Korea but also for Southeast Asia. This is partly a role Japan has played
ever since the reconstruction of Japan, politically
and economically, in the 1950s. You can also see in this chart how Southeast Asia's economies and cities have
continued to develop. It's a complex chart, but basically, a
simple way of looking at it is, the symbols in green represent
exports in the 1920s. The symbols in red represent exports in
the 2000s. As you can see, the symbols in red tend to
be more numerous, except for Burma, than the symbols in green. Greatly expanded trade, and a much more diverse range of things that are being
traded. For example, look at Malaysia. Look at how narrowly based their trade was
in the 1920s, mainly in things like tin and rubber, just
those two export items. But now look at the whole range of items
that are being exported from Malaysia in the
2000s. Then you can also see the growth of
Cities, cities with more than 3 million
inhabitants, not only in Jakarta but also in Bandung. But look at the cities with one to three
million inhabitants, Surabaya, Semarang, Palembang, Medan,
Ujung Pandang, huge growth of urbanization in a country
like Indonesia. Here's a contrasting story for South
Africa. In the 1980s, South Africa was still torn
by a system of racial apartheid, where the
settler colonists, descended from the Dutch and the English, established a
literal racial hierarchy and even confined portions of the black
population to living in puppet homelands. That's the map you see here. And here is a map of South Africa today,
under black rule, the dominant party being the
African National Congress. And South Africa, instead of being a
divided country torn by civil turmoil, though it still has
significant problems, is an economic engine, not only for South
Africa, but radiating northward as a regional hub
for an economic system across Southern Africa. Botswana, whose label is omitted from this
map, actually is an African country that's
doing quite well. The global growth of urbanization is
another phenomenon we've been talking about from time to time in
the course. Alright, take you back, traditional world,
no more than 10 to 15% of the population lives in towns or
cities. That's traditional world: 10 to 15%.
Britain by the late 1800s, let's say 1870, 60% of its
population is living in towns and cities. England is the most urbanized place in the
world in 1870. That kind of 60% threshold, the United
States of America won't even catch up to that threshold until it's
into the 20th century. That 60% threshold of urbanization is now going to
be reached by the entire world population, as a whole, by
the year 2030. Notice the trend since 1950, where global
urbanization numbers are around 30%, that includes Europe, the United States, parts
of South America, other developed areas. 30% worldwide going up to 60% worldwide just in the space of
this time period. Here's another way of diagramming the
urbanization of the world. Numbers of large cities with a least a
million inhabitants. You can see the situation here in 1900. Now take a look at 1950.
50 years later, how many cities with a million inhabitants, where they are.
Now take a look 50 years after that in 2000. Remember some of the things that go with
large scale urbanization: Not only concentrations of cultural
interaction, financial interaction, educational opportunities,
also new kinds of problems. Remember we talked about how government institutions needed to catch up with
urbanization. They needed to provide all kinds of services they hadn't provided before,
including crime control. Well, of course now, most of the world is experiencing those stresses and strains,
that kind of catch up. There are very serious problems today in
providing adequate policing in cities like Sao Paulo in
Brazil or New Delhi in India. But those are the challenges these
countries are having to surmount. And as they surmount those challenges,
their public institutions are going to get
stronger and stronger. This presentation seems like a basically
positive portrait, and it is. There's some really terrific books by
people like Charles Kenny that also offer sort of an upbeat picture of what's going on,
including in a lot of the less-developed world, including capabilities that don't
get quite picked up in pictures of just real income. When you really dig into what people can
now buy with their income, the services that are now available to them that weren't available
before. But let's balance that portrait with a
look at what I call outliers. We'll do that in the next presentation.
See you then.
