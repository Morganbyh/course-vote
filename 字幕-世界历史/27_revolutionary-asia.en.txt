Welcome back.
Make yourself comfortable. Let's now go around the world and look at
revolutionary Asia in the late 1940s. Huge world historical events are happening
here. There are two revolutionary models really
in play for the whole future of China, the most populous
country on Earth. The first actually is the Nationalist
Chinese model, the Guomindang, Because, after all, they had started as a
revolutionary party back in the 1920s, taking the place of the warlords,
antiforeign, Chiang Kai Shek looking to models, both
in Moscow and even in the fascist countries,
for ideas of how to organize his nationalist
state. Very much the image now of the national conservative, the top-down
modernizer, the restorer of ancient Chinese traditions in a
modernized China. The United States of America, during the
war, takes a lead in sponsoring nationalist China as a
future great power. Indeed, it's Franklin Roosevelt and the
American administration that say that China should
be a permanent member of the Security Council of the new United Nations they're
creating. The United States helps bring together a summit meeting in
which Chiang is treated as the leader of a world power, in this summit meeting in Cairo with Roosevelt, Churchill and
Chiang: 1943. Of course the other revolutionary model,
the Communist model, represented by the
Chinese Communist Party. Its signature leader, Mao Zedong. You've seen these images before of Mao in
the 1930s. The young firebrand, the charismatic
orator. The party officials seen here huddled at a
party meeting with Zhou Enlai. I especially like this picture. You kind of have a sense of the unheated
room, with the men having to wear their coats even
though they're indoors, conferring at a party meeting surrounded
by the papers, yet that sense of informality, of a
revolutionary movement. Both of these revolutionary models are
backed by great powers, though the Soviet Union also hopes to
have good relations with the Nationalist
government, as well. In 1947, the civil war takes a decisive turn because of decisions being made by
both sides. So, at the beginning of 1947, if you'd
been taking bets on what's going to happen in the
Chinese Civil War, most of the smart folks would've told you that the Nationalists were probably
going to win. And the Communists were a lot of trouble, but the Nationalists bound to
win. Here's the map in 1947. From the Nationalist Chinese point of
view, they are holding this blue line; they are holding
these places in Manchuria. They've got most of the country. Communists are in this area, getting some
supplies from the Soviet Union, but the Nationalists are hoping they're
going to launch an offensive that's going to decisively
defeat the Communists in 1947. But meanwhile, while the Nationalist
government, the Guomindang, is trying to decisively
defeat the Communists, they're also moving their
capital and trying to reestablish a state, because most of this had been occupied by
the Japanese, it's in chaos. So they're both fighting a war and trying to rebuild a state in lands that had been ravaged by years of
warfare. They're moving their capital from here,
Chongqing, Chungking is the way they used to call it, back here to where their capitol had been,
in Nanjing. So the Guomindang is trying to rebuild the
state at the same time it's fighting a civil
war. It's overextended, its economic base is fragile, it's
spending a ton of money trying to reestablish public services, but
there's not a sound basis for the currency. It begins to tip over into economic chaos
and hyperinflation, again, while they're still
trying to fight this war. The Chinese Civil War isn't nearly as well
understood as some other huge events like, say, the
American Civil War or World War II, for example, or even the
Vietnam War. And that's puzzling, because this is a
civil war that's deciding the fate of the most populous
country on Earth. The fate of China is clearly pretty
important in world history. So it's worth just taking a few minutes to
feel like we understand the outcome of the
Civil War better. Now it wouldn't be interesting if the
outcome of the Civil War was just a foregone
conclusion: Nationalists kind of rotten, Communists bound to win. But actually that's not where I think
modern historians are, like the Norwegian Odd Arne Westad argues
that the outcome of the Civil War was really up in the air in 1947
and 1948. So, what I'll try to do to help bring this kind of obscure patch of
extremely important history alive for you, is show you about five minutes worth of film from a
wonderful documentary made and shown in the United States during
the 1960s. This documentary does a really nice job of covering the ground of the Civil War very
quickly but using just some remarkable film
footage taken at the time that kind of brings that period and
people to life. Just kind of look at the people, the
machines, the scenes they're showing you. There's really a lot there in those five
minutes. Let's take a look. >> [SOUND] The Nationalists, with all the transport of America at their
disposal, enplane their troops to seize the cities
of the Yangtze Valley. This ease of movement will lead them onto
larger appetite. Dispersion of their forces up from the
Yangtze to seize the cities not only of North China
but beyond. Manchuria, with its vital industry of
rails. Nor will the Communists sit still. Together, Mao and Zhou, like Chiang, decide
the key lies in Manchuria. They choose Lin Biao as field commander
to make the dash. From Yenan, in North China, they will
strike east and north, while Chiang is readying troops to move from
Yangtze ports and airfields. [MUSIC] By foot and pack train, Lin Biao sets out. The Russians have temporarily occupied
Manchuria by the surrender terms with Japan. Communists expect to get from Russians
surrendered Japanese equipment and guns and hold the countryside before Chiang
arrives. [MUSIC] The rumble of inevitable clash causes
America to replace Hurley with General George
Marshall. This architect of global victory is sent
to save the peace for which so brilliantly he
labored. Received by Chiang Kai-Shek, Marshall
gropes for American solutions to the bitter revolutionary surges of a strange Asian nation, torn by barbarisms a generation
old. To his Chongqing headquarters, he invites a communist delegation led by
Zhou Enlai, chief communist negotiator, to meet with
Chiang Kai-Shek's spokesmen. Marshall suggests, and they agree to, an American answer for China's groping search
for order. A federal government peacefully permitting
the two parties to govern provinces they now hold
politically. Freedom of speech permitted everywhere,
and disputes resolved by talk, not guns. [MUSIC] In January 1946, both parties celebrate a
truce with a handshake. No paper truce, however, can mend a nation
ripped apart by 50 years of killing. Within two months, troops are on the move
again. Each side blames the other. But a hundred savage skirmishes now flare to
full-scale war. Manchuria is the cockpit of the struggle. The industry Japan has built and left is
the greatest prize in China. Chiangï¿½s American-equipped troops seize all
major cities to find a hollow triumph. The Russian occupiers have looted every
factory before withdrawal, ripped-out sockets show where
great machines once stood. For Mao, the fighting in Manchuria is
prelude to the climax of his theories: the day when guerrilla bands group into
formal armies and shove frontal combat at a
weary enemy. He fights for more than safety now. His ambition seeks to mold all of China to
his theories. >> I asked Mao Zedong what their
policy was with regard to freedom of the press and he said they
believe in absolute freedom of press and absolute freedom of speech,
and it wasn't going to be like Chongqing when
they won. Everybody would have the right to say
whatever he felt. There wouldn't be censorship the way
Chiang Kai-Shek had in Chongqing. So I said you, you really mean that?
He said, of course we mean it. And I said, do you mean that if you come
to power, anybody will be able to print anything he wants in a newspaper, or publish any newspaper he
wants? And Mao Zedong said, of course, he said,
except for enemies of the people. Nor did he ever define, and I was too
young to ask him to define, what he meant by
enemies of the people. Obviously, now it means anybody who
disagrees with him. >> In summer ï¿½46, Chiang returns his
government to Nanjing and once again, as 17 years before, reports the victory of his cause at Sun
Yat-sen's mausoleum. The fighting in the North is only distant
thunder in the Yangtze Valley. American advisers urge he seize this
moment to win the hearts and firm the loyalties of his
people by new reforms. Thus in Nanjing, Chiang convenes a congress
to write a modern constitution, in one last try to govern China by the order
Sun Yat-sen has preached. But the thrust of all his background is
still military. His troops must win by force of arms. With American arms, he feels the
Communists can be crushed, but his troops dig in to garrison rail
junctions, cities they have occupied. American advisers insist such static
defense is major error. They say he pins down his best divisions where Communist guerrillas will
isolate them. >> So against that backdrop, the big
powers make some key decisions. In 1947, the Soviet government decides to
really make a decisive effort to help the
Communists win. They've been trying to kind of play both
sides because they thought the Nationalists
might be in charge. In ï¿½47, they really commit themselves to
Communist victory. The Americans are also making some key
decisions in 1947. Marshall had been very disillusioned with
the Nationalist government from his
experiences there in 1946. And actually, the Americans eliminated much of
their assistance to China in early 1947. They were selling them some stuff for
cash, in a situation where the Chinese were not
flush with money. They weren't really giving up, giving away
very much except some equipment that they
couldn't use. A representative of the American military,
a gentleman named Wedemeyer, actually went to China in
late ï¿½47. He comes back with a report, really interesting. Basically says: Yep, the Chinese government
has big flaws. But we need to go in heavily there, get
them to make the reforms that they need to make, and then
back them with a lot of money, a lot of military advisers, help
them figure out how to fight and win the Civil War, give them the
finances to do it. So if we go in, we get them to make the
changes they need to make, we go in with the advisers and the money to make good on
it, so that we win the Civil War. Marshall quashes the Wedemeyer report. He just does not think that the United
States should make a huge investment, an intervention,
in this Chinese Civil War. Fundamentally, he's decided to just kind
of let the chips fall where they may, and that he's going to concentrate his
energy on trying to rescue Europe. That turns into decisive differences
during 1948. Moscow ups its play. A key official, Anastas Mikoyan, goes to
China, meets with the Chinese. The Chinese tell Mikoyan that they view
the Soviet Union as their model for how to build the
state. The lavish him with praise, compliments.
They're his pupils, he's the teacher. Mao in fact, is very worried that the
Americans are going to intervene in the Civil War, that thousands of American soldiers are going to come
into play. But those fears turn out to be
unrealistic. Marshall, in fact, goes to the Congress,
which is very worried about China, and says, okay, you want to give aid to
China, go ahead. His deal with the Congress says: You want
to start giving aid to China in 1948? Appropriate the money. Because the bargain
he wants is he wants Congress to appropriate the
money for European needs, for the European
Recovery Program. That's the political deal he makes;
they'll help Europe in exchange for his going along with their
doing something for China. Of course, by the time a lot of that money
and equipment will arrive in China to help the Nationalists, there won't be a lot, there won't be American advisers
attached to it. And the money and help will be too late. It will be too late to save the
Nationalist government, which begins to lose decisive battles in the
second half of 1948. And then their fortunes decline faster and
faster, to the point that the Communists conquer all of
China in 1949. Now you have to stop and reflect on the effects of this, and what a momentous
development this is. If you're thinking about a struggle to
quote contain communism, well you've just failed to contain communism in
the most populous country on Earth, a country that a lot of people have
realized for a hundred years is a potential pivot in the
course of world history. China has gone communist, and indeed it's created a whole model for revolutionary
change: coming out of the countryside, organizing the peasants, land reform, it's showing poor countries a model for
revolution. And for Stalin and Mao, who get together
to celebrate Stalin's 70th birthday in this photograph, they're talking
together: What are the new possibilities? What's the new world? And for Stalin, and Mao, they look
together at the world of East Asia and they see a
world full of turmoil. Again, here's that standard map from 1948. Korea, divided. A kind of low-grade civil war going on
between the Soviet-sponsored regime in the North and an American
supported regime in the South. In turmoil. The leader of the communists
there wants the Soviets and Chinese to help him
overrun the South. In Taiwan, the Nationalists have fled here as their
last refuge. Mao wants to launch an invasion across the
Taiwan Straits that will wipe them out and occupy Taiwan
for Communist rule. In Indo-China, the Viet Minh are seeking support from the new Chinese Communist
government and the Soviet Union in their battle against the French and their Vietnamese
allies. Even in the Philippines, an insurgency rages against the new republic there, supported by the American government, from
an insurgency called the Huks, who also
would like to get some support here. And there are arguments about the future
of this new country, Indonesia, that's taking the
place of the Netherlands Indies, where there's a strong Indonesian
Communist Party that wants to play a role in that part of the world,
too. And as for the Americans: What do they
think? 1949 is a tough year for the American
government, for a lot of reasons we'll get into more next
week. But basically, they're hoping that the Chinese will be more nationalist than
communist. That they'll come to disagree with the
Soviets and, who knows, maybe the Americans will be able to forge
better relations with them. And in a way, their whole experience with
China has raised with them a key dilemma. Here you are. You've got this government that you like. But the government you like is very deeply
flawed. Frankly, if it weren't deeply flawed, it wouldn't be involved in a civil war,
probably. So you have this deeply flawed government. What do you do?
Option one, do you bolster them? Do you just give a ton of help to that
flawed government? Sure, you're going to argue to them that, if I'm going to give
you all this help, you need to change, you need to fix
all these flaws. So do you bolster the flawed government,
hoping you can get them to fix and change themselves. Or do you say you're so flawed, it's not worth pouring money into
you? We should just abandon you and leave you
to your fate. From the point of view of some Americans,
China offered a lesson from both schools. They should have bolstered Chiang, should
have intervened in the Civil War. Or there's an argument that no, China was
best left to its fate and maybe it will work out for the best. How this whole story will work out, how the Soviet and Chinese plans and
ambitions played out against these American hopes and fears,
we'll see next week. See you then. [BLANK_AUDIO]
