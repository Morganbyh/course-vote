Hi. In this presentation, I want to focus on
new thinking that's going on in the East Bloc, especially the
Soviet Union, in the late 1980s. All through this course, we've talked
about how new thinking happens, that it just doesn't come out of the blue. That first, there's a situation people
understand. And you try to understand, what they
noticed about the situation. You look at what problems or opportunities
did they see in that situation. Then, what kind of solutions did they
think they had. And you see what solutions they chose. And then how that created a new situation. So to explain the new thinking in the
Soviet Union, which has momentous consequences, you start by noticing that
they think they're in a period of crisis. In other words, they see a situation. They see problems. By the way, your later hindsight
understanding of what the situation was, in your
opinion, or what problems they should have seen, is
interesting but you can't let that blur your ability to see the problem as
they saw it, through their eyes. And also, it's really important to think
about what their alternatives were in their minds. They're not going to make a move to do something unless they believe they've got
a viable option. So, what is the problem as Soviet leaders
might have perceived it in the middle of the
1980s? From their point of view, they look at their leadership, and they see an aging old
guard. Brezhnev dies. Andropov dies. Chernenko dies. Men in
their 70s, even in their 80s, this is the image of the Soviet
leadership to many of the Soviet people. The impassive leaders, standing on the
reviewing stand. They also notice the political
international trends. After the big crisis of 1983 as you go
into ï¿½84, ï¿½85, there's a definite sense in the Soviet Union that the political and
international momentum seems to be running a bit against
them, that they feel more and more isolated by the way things
are going. But that's not all, they've got this war
grinding on in Afghanistan, killing Soviet soldiers every month, draining Soviet attention, Soviet
prestige. As they look at their economic situation,
they also see problems. Imagine: Youï¿½re in the Soviet leadership,
it's 1985, 1986, you're looking at how the economies of the world are doing.
Now you saw this chart before. I showed it to you, in 1976, to give you a sense of the way Chinese leaders might
have seen the world. Now I've run it forward to 1986. Now again, the Soviet leaders did not have
this chart. But I think this chart gives you some
sense of the way the world looked to people in the
mid-1980s, when they tried to figure out which
economies were most dynamic. And what you'd notice here, look at the green line for the Soviet Union, it's
flattening out. Look at the contrast, even with a country
like South Korea, between the situation in 1966 in the Soviet Union and
now look, 20 years later. You might even notice that China is
beginning to slowly pick up. You look around the Soviet Union and they see the aging consequences of a devotion
to heavy industry, to the mining and exploitation of raw
materials. This map is just one way of graphically
depicting that layout. An interesting thing about this map is it
uses the color orange to point out areas of severe environmental damage,
around these areas where a lot of mineral exploitation has
occurred. And you can see how extensive these are, including this area
around Chernobyl, where a Soviet nuclear reactor, in 1986, suffered
a catastrophic meltdown. At the end of the 1970s, though, the
Soviet economy had good news. All that oil they were producing was
selling on the world markets for a terrific price. The Soviets were bringing in all sorts of
hard currency. They could use that to get terrific loans from the West to buy lots of consumer
goods and other things. But from the point of view of a Soviet
leader in, say 1986, take a look at what's happened to
their income from oil sales. Here's 1986 right here.
You can see what's happened to the oil price. That drop means that their income from oil
sales is less than half of what it was only a few years
earlier. If that's your principal source of hard
Currency, and then you need that hard currency to service those
loans you took out in the banner days, loans that are also
helping you subsidize some of the economies dependent on you in Eastern
Europe, you have a severe debt problem, severe problems in maintaining the
standard of living your citizens had started getting
accustomed to having. And then of course, the Soviets are
looking over their shoulders at China. Again, imagine the year, it's ï¿½85, ï¿½86,
here's some of the way the world was perceiving China in
1985, 1986. For instance, this cover of Time Magazine
captures the popular mood from September 1985. [LAUGH] By the way, you can see this, on
the wall screen over here on the left, in
traditional Chinese style, carrying the posters of Karl Marx with the
citizens working in rice paddies. And, now look.
[LAUGH]. Riding bicycles.
Blue jeans. Cameras. Tennis shoes. Time Magazine, in fact, named Deng
Xiaoping its Man of the Year for 1985. And here you see a collage of images that
captures what he seems to represent in the eye of the
world right then. If you're a Soviet leader, how are you
processing this? What do you make of this? And then you might also ask yourself, what
is the real path to the security of the
Soviet Union? Should we continue to invest principally
in our military establishment as the path to security or should we have
some other conceptions? So question, do they have some other
conceptions? Are they seeing any alternative?
Answer is yes, they are. In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev becomes the new
leader of the Soviet Union. He truly represents a model product of the
Soviet communist system. Born in the Caucasus, his family had experienced some of the
terrors of Stalinism. But he's risen through the ranks, the best
Party schools, all the good experience in government. The other leaders would look at him as a youthful, dynamic person, thoroughly
imbued with all the training the Soviet socialist
system can provide to its young leaders. Gorbachev looks around and analyzes the
communist movement as of the 1980s. He's quite taken with some of the ideas of the Eurocommunist parties in places like Spain, and
especially in Italy. Taken with the way they're trying to bring back ideas of democratic socialism in the
redefinition of communism. He adopts, after he comes
in, the goal of perestroika: renewal for the
Soviet Union. He wants to reduce foreign requirements.
In other words, let's ease up on confrontations with the West so that I
can cut back on the amount of resources I have to devote to my military
establishment and can put more into my domestic economy. He also believes in glasnost: a new
openness, a more open dialogue about the problems of
the country, the past of the country, and options for
the future. Why, you might ask, did the Soviet leadership choose someone like this to
lead the country in 1985?
Well, a couple points. One, it was a very close call in 1985. There was no inevitability about the selection of Gorbachev from among the
field. His principal rival, the party boss of
Leningrad, might've been selected and the Soviet Union might've
followed a very different path. But Gorbachev was the man they picked.
After the previous three leaders, that image of youthful dynamism and his reputed successes with
Soviet agriculture seemed to make him look like the best guy. But a really important explanation for why Gorbachev adopts this agenda and has
support for a while, is that he's embodying multiple agendas of people within the
communist elite. On the one hand, he does embody the agenda of people who really do want to liberalize
the definition of communism.
People like this man, Alexander Yakolev, a long time Communist
Party official that had spent a lot of time serving in foreign
countries. He'd thought a lot about how to renew the
Soviet system. Take, for example, this memorandum that
Yakolev wrote secretly to Gorbachev at the end of 1985. You can see on the priority of political
development. He believes the Soviet Union really needs
to change its political system in order to keep up with what
modern times demand. You can see here he's arguing to invigorate the legislative side of the
Soviet government. Because right now, of course, the
legislature is really a nominal legislature that's
crushed by the executive power. He's talking here about votes of
confidence, a decisive strengthening of accountability on the part of the
executive branch. He wants policy discussions to be real
discussions, not just dry reports. Elections, he writes, should be not just a
selection but a choice and, importantly, a choice
among the best. Notice how he keeps finding quotes from
Lenin that make these arguments seem like they're in tune with
the original communist inspiration. And notice here his argument on the
Payoff: colossal increase in real responsibility
for the masses, accountability, and mainly, a
genuine engagement of the masses in the management of the affairs of the region, oblast, republic,
and country. Transformation of local governments into
genuine organs of power. And again, he renews the argument that for
this you need glasnost, you need openness. Again, he finds a quote from Lenin, to
affirm that value, thorough and timely information an unavoidable
condition of the further democratization of public
life. These are pretty radical views to be
expressing secretly at the top of the communist
government. But Yakovlev and that kind of agenda is only one of the tributaries to new
thinking. Another really powerful tributary actually
comes from people in the mainstream Soviet
national security establishment. People like this man, Marshal Sergey
Akhromeyev. Akhromeyev is an innovative, vigorous
military thinker. He believes the Soviet military is
going to have trouble keeping up with the American military unless it can adopt scientific
and technical revolutions, innovate rapidly,
show real agility. He thinks new thinking, and renewal, is also critical to the renewal
of the Soviet military to keep it strong. So you see the converging agenda that Gorbachev pulls into his coalition for new
thinking -- not only more liberal-minded people like
Yakovlev, but also people who believe that somehow
the Soviet system needs to be rebooted in
order to make it stronger in very traditional
terms. It's that combination that gives Gorbachev vital domestic political
momentum to carry forward his ideas about new thinking in the late 1980s and open up
a world of new possibilities. We'll explore what happened in that world
next time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
