[BLANK_AUDIO] Hi.
Welcome back. Last time we talked about zero hour, the
sense of starting from scratch. Let's look at that from another angle. Suppose you're a leader who is trying to
build a new country. How would you imagine the future of that
new country? Think about the scope for imagination that
a new leader would have. You've got them all over the place, because you've got countries that are
completely defeated. They have to figure out how to rebuild,
recover. You have ideologies that have been
completely discredited. Naziism is down, for example. Fascism is discredited.
What takes its place? You've got millions of people who've been
displaced from their homes trying to figure out new
starts: where they're going to live, what kind of
new countries they'll call themselves. The Jews of Europe, for example, many of
them are migrating to Palestine, a territory under the control of a British
government mandate. You've got dreams that have been deferred
for a long time. For example, in Great Britain itself, for
years and years they've been undergoing rationing of
one kind or another. When they elect a Labour government in the
elections of 1945, for many Englishmen it was as if
their dreams had been deferred, it was time to try to build that new land
that they'd been hoping for through the years
of Depression and war. I'd like you to think too, about the
situation of a particular kind of leader, especially in
the colonies of decaying empires. I call them here, lonely pilgrims. Think about the pilgrims, though, if you
study American history, pilgrims who land in the
New World and are trying to imagine a new
place. Think about the leaders in a place like
colonial Burma, for example. They're trying to imagine a new place that
they're going to build, and I think of them as
lonely, because they don't have large
organizations, ready-made political parties, big institutions that they just
kind of step into. There is a sense of organizational
loneliness, there are just a handful of these people in
different clusters trying to imagine new countries. Who are these people?
Let me give you some illustrations. In China, you could look at a man like Mao
Zedong. He'd been leading the Chinese Communist
Party, literally in the wilderness during the 1930s and much of
World War II. As the war ends, his Chinese Communists have also been fighting the
Japanese. The Nationalist government has been badly
bludgeoned by the war with the Japanese, too. He's seeing a lot of different
opportunities. Here's Mao during the 1930s. A little different from the iconic
photographs of him perhaps you've been used to seeing. Here's another image of Mao in the 1930s, notice everybody is in these standardized
drab uniforms. If you went to India, you'd find men like
this, on the left is Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru's simple clothes, like the way
Gandhi is dressed, both belie the fact that these men
have been trained at the elite level of the British public
school and university system. They were able to function very capably in
both worlds. East and West. Or take this man, a new rising figure calling for the Dutch East Indies to
become a new country called Indonesia. This is a Time magazine cover depicting
him. I like these Time magazine covers a lot
for the purpose of this course. Because, see, what Time was
trying to do with these covers, it tries to capture, in a single
graphic image, a whole story that it wants to represent to tens
of millions of Americans. And they get the best graphic artists available in the country to help
them put together an image that tells that
story. They do a really good job with it, but it's also of historical interest
because it's kind of capturing the way these people in New
York are trying to explain these events to
other Americans. So it also gives you a little bit of a
sense of the belief systems of American editors in
midtown Manhattan in, say, in this case, the end of 1946.
You notice the caption here, Indonesia's quote unquote President Soekarno.
A roar for freedom, a reach for power. It's kind of an ambivalent picture. Do you sympathize with this man, or are
you frightened by him? As they look out at these countries
they're imagining, they've got all kinds of decisions like, what are the
contours of this country? What are its borders? How do we define these new nations? Take the problem of someone like Soekarno
in the country he imagines, Indonesia. He's building on a Dutch colony, the Dutch
East Indies. Here's a map of the Dutch East Indies. The capital of the Dutch East Indies is
this city here, Batavia, which we now know as
Jakarta. You see the scale of miles up here. This is a huge area being covered. New Guinea, Java, Sumatra, Borneo, these
are very different places. Lots of different ethnic identities,
different tribes, the Moluccans here, the Dayaks
here. Different religious beliefs. For instance,
Islam very strong on the island of Java. What should be the borders of a new
country called Indonesia? Should it be one country?
Should it be several countries? Should its borders include all of Borneo?
What about this part of Borneo up here? Should its borders cross the Straits of
Malacca, and so on. And then if you think about these lonely
pilgrims, think about their ladders for success. Maybe you're in your job if you think
about your ladder as, I go to university or maybe I go to graduate school or I get some professional
training. Or I'm in a business and I'm moving up the
hierarchy in my company. For these young leaders, their ladders of
success are complex because they're living in hierarchies
mainly established by colonial powers. So they're often climbing ladders that
have been designed by the colonial power they're
trying to overthrow. So there's this ambivalence is, I'm
climbing a ladder that ends up leading to Paris, or to London, but actually I'm
trying to raise my level in a different kind of
community that I'm trying to create. What are the kind of models these young leaders might look to?
They're looking around the world. How do you design this country? Well, you kind of, what's a successful
country? Which one do I want to model myself after? Do I want to model it after one of the
democracies? Is that appealing? Is it too hard? How about the communists? They seem to have some good models for how
to take countries with lots and lots of poor
people and make them pretty strong and independent
pretty quickly. And the communists always talked about
being against imperialism. What about if you're against communism,
but you think democracy is unappealing, too
hard? But you don't like the communists? Say for example, the position of many
Muslims, who thought about politics. Muslim politicians, many of them are
pretty deeply religious. The doctrines of communism scorn religion. Marx talked about it as the opiate of the
masses. So if you're a Muslim, anti-communist,
but you're not as interested in democracy, what kind of political ideology or model
do you look to? If you look, for example, to Turkey,
Turkey had ostentatiously pointed itself toward
secularism, limiting the role of Islam. Difficult choices. Some ideologues in the Muslim world, for
example, are looking at blends of fascism, socialism, but that's Arab and secular, a pan-Arab ideology, a pan-Arab kind of
empire. Or maybe there are other models to look
at. Again, we come back to this issue of
ideologies. We've talked about ideologies in some past
presentations. These families of ideas, systematic
beliefs organizing the way you think about the world. Beliefs that tell you who you are, what's
your principle identity: national, class, race, ethnic. It gives you a whole narrative, and my groupies, people I'm a part of,
we're on a journey that's going from here to here
to here. The ideology supplies you with that ready-made 
narrative, a way to interpret key events of the recent past
that everybody knows about. It gives you the words to use,
vocabularies that other people will also understand and
recognize. And it gives you programs, policy
programs, things to do, how to build your country, recipes. Back in 1900, we showed you this menu of
the families of political beliefs. Political parties is a simplified way of
talking about it. And around 1900, you've seen this slide
before, with the Revolutionary Socialists, National
Tradition parties, monarchists kind of on the fringes. The centrists: Democratic Socialists, many
of them Marxist, Liberals, top-down modernizers, the
National Conservatives, often very pro empire.
But from the 1900 to the 1920s, we saw the way the revolutionaries morphed into a
Fascist movement and a Communist movement, which now share comparable influence
with the old movements that were more in the
center. And then how that evolved in the 1920s, in the crisis years of the 1930s. The extremists: Communism much stronger,
Fascism stronger, but also this interesting fusion in the
center that creates the Social Democrats. Now let's talk about what happens in the postwar period, in the 1930s to the
postwar. Fascism is profoundly discredited by World
War II. Its leading examples were Italy and
Germany, both in ruins. Japan was clearly flirting with Fascism,
if not a wholly Fascist ideology, also in
ruins. So its influence as a political ideology doesn't seem to extend far beyond Francoï¿½s
Spain. The National Conservatives, the top-down
modernizers, they then pick up some of that loss, become a robust ideology again. Liberals, believers in small government,
the ideals of liberalism maybe strengthened by the war, but
liberalism as a way of organizing political action somehow
seems more and more quaint to people of the late 1940s
and 1950s. Communists, if anything, are even
stronger. The Soviet Union having shown its strength
in the Second World War. Democratic Socialists there as a faction,
but not noticeably strengthened. But Social Democracy very strong indeed. In a way, the United States and its system
seeming to be a paragon for it. Then for the people who are trying to
imagine new countries, you take these families of ideas, and you
try to adapt them to your local situation, trying to pick up opportunities that life is creating for
you. One ideology I want to come back to, dwell some more on, is this business of social
democracy. I've alluded to it before very briefly,
but it's worth a closer look, because obviously a really
important set of political ideas after World War Two. So let's just kind of break down what are
the elements of social democracy? What makes it distinctive? My own view, influenced by the take of a number of scholars, including Jeffrey
Frieden, is to look at a few key elements.
Just a few. One, the belief in countercyclical
macroeconomics. The notion that I can influence supply and demand with governmental action. Now there are monetary versions of this
and fiscal versions of this. But that I can spend money or change the
value of money in order to influence the
performance of my economy. It's a strong role in government
management of the economy. If it's going down, push it up. If it's overheating going up too fast,
slow it down, cool it off. Of course the great figure identified with
countercyclical macroeconomics is this man, the British economist John Maynard Keynes, whose writings were so
influential during the 1930s, but even more so beyond. Keynes himself is not a doctrinaire
ideologue, either in his personal or professional
life. But he was an immensely practical man who believed that doctrinaire liberals
weren't giving enough room for the possibilities of
government action. The second key element of Social
Democracy: use social insurance to provide people with more personal security in their
lives. Health insurance, old age insurance,
unemployment insurance. That the government ought to play the role
in managing risk for a lot of people. That if you do this, you'll ameliorate
class warfare, cushion the effects of the new industrial
societies that are coming with modern life.
And another distinctive feature of Social Democracy is this sense of government in
partnership with labor. In a way you see big corporations, big
unions, the government supports them both because
it wants the big corporations to help organize and manage economic life.
It wants big unions so that the workers are powerful enough to offset
the power of big corporations. And that means you need big government as
the umpire in this understanding of society. That sense of the part, the new
partnership between government and labor is picked up a little bit in
this photograph. The man on the left is the American
president, Harry Truman. The man on the right is an especially interesting leader of these new big labor
unions. He's Walter Reuther. He's the president of the United Auto
Workers, one of the most powerful and progressive
among the new unions that are playing such a dominant role,
offsetting the power of the big three auto manufacturers: Ford,
Chrysler, General Motors. Led by the American government, with some support from the British government,
there's also a distinctive vision emerging for the
global economy and how to rebuild that. Last time I stressed how important that
was to the Americans, because they wanted to
avoid a renewal of the Great Depression, revive world
trade. How do you do that? Well, first you've got to create a new
kind of standardized money. If, if money 1.0 was the old gold standard, money 2.0, rebooted after World War II, is this: it's a gold dollar standard. And what
makes that different? Instead of relying on a finite amount of
the yellow metal, you have a finite amount of yellow metal linked to a whole
lot of paper, called dollars. You can have a certain amount of gold, but
you can also have a lot of dollars. As long as the exchange rate between gold and dollars was itself relatively stable,
dollars also became a hard currency on which people
could set exchange rates. So this required very strong control of the money supply by the United States
government as the anchor for this new system of world
currency in the American economic orbit. That Bretton Woods conference that helped
settle the future of the international financial system, was
held in New Hampshire, Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.
It was dominated by these two men. The British representative on the right,
that's Keynes, again. The man on the left is the American
treasury official, Harry Dexter White. Recent documents have shown that White was
very sympathetic to the Soviet government during the 1940s, and in
contact with Soviet intelligence agents. In a way to understand White, you understand a man who actually was
sympathetic to the big government, managed economy
approach of the Soviet government and thought a managed economy approach was
going to be very important to the United States in the post
war period. So in a way, the Bretton Woods system is not about wide open, unregulated
capitalism. The Bretton Woods system is about very
managed economies with big governments creating a very carefully controlled
international financial system. In that system, the United States
government supported a revival of free trade, the breaking down of trade walls,
the breaking down of imperial barriers. But with that, the United States was going
to carefully regulate the free movement of money, because part of their financial system was one that required firm
government control of the movement of currency, of capital
across borders. In other words, this is not like the financial system we have in the world
today. And a third key pillar of the world
economy was to create international institutions to supply some
money, to supply some assistance to hardship
cases. So there is something created called an
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
for the governments to fund a bank that can then invest in capital goods in countries trying to
rebuild. This is what today we call the World Bank. Combined with a humanitarian relief
organization run by the United Nations, the UN Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration, which did enormous good, perhaps saving
hundreds of thousands of lives in the aftermath of World War
II, distributing assistance to people in need. You can see in this picture, this is taken
in Belgium, in 1946. You see the nun handing out food to the
hungry children, many of them barefoot. You see that box there right next to her:
UNRRA. That's the source of the food that's
helping to keep these children alive. So if you step back, you see the
characteristic views of Social Democrats, both for organizing their own countries
and for trying to rebuild an international
system that has an element of cooperation in it and carefully managed cooperation for
economic growth. Next time, we'll talk about how that vision
of international cooperation runs up against the creation
of two different worlds.
