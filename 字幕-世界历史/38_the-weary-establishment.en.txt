Hi, welcome back. Make yourself comfortable. In this
presentation, you'll see why the 1970s was a tough time to be an authority
figure. Let's look at the wary establishment by
starting off with the status quo. The status quo had these creaky managerial
states we'd been talking about. A sense among a lot of people that socialists, capitalists, they are
all these big ministries, big bureaucratic entities,
they're all engaged in this competition, military
competition that just feeds the governments, feeds the
corporations, they are all alike. Meanwhile, the economic models of social
democracy and socialism and throughout the Third World were beginning
to run into trouble. One of the first phenomena worth noticing
is what economists call the Great Inflation
of the 1970s. One way to visualize that Great Inflation
is this chart prepared by economist Christina Romer and published in
the bulletin of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. If you just look at the 1970s, you can see
the levels of inflation in five of the leading countries
all moving into the double digit realm. What's going on here? A couple of things are going on. First, the governments are just spending a
lot of money, printing money, in order to try to not only meet social services and maintain military spending, like the
United States during the Vietnam War, but also because
they're trying to combat increasing unemployment
with government spending. They believe in a rigid relationship
between inflation and unemployment. They believe, because that was the conventional economic orthodoxy of the
time, that if inflation goes up, unemployment is
bound to come down, and vice versa. Since they want to combat unemployment,
they tolerate increased inflation, they think it's okay
to spend more money even if that devalues the
currency. But it turns out that relationship isn't
as rigid as they thought. You can have both high inflation and high
unemployment, and all these governments discover that
fact in the 1970s. Another factor that's leading to the great
inflation is a spike in oil prices in the early 1970s and
the late 1970s, I'll touch on in a moment. But before we get to that, another key
factor in the economic breakdown is the end of the
Bretton Woods financial system. Just to remind you a bit of some of that international financial history we
covered, I think I talked a little bit about World Money 1.0 as being a gold exchange
standard, especially between about 1870 and 1914,
and then rebuilt a little after World War I until it
finally collapsed. And then in the aftermath of World War II,
we get World Money 2.0. That's the Bretton Woods System. What's that? That's really a gold dollar standard, in
which you both have gold as an anchor, but then you can print dollars
that everyone can rely on. But the United States finds that its
overseas spending, importing goods from other countries, spending money to sustain its forces and commitments
overseas, they're having trouble maintaining the
value of the dollar. They would have to do things like hiking
interest rates that they don't want to do in order to maintain the value
of the dollar against gold. Finally, they just decide to break the
gold dollar standard and the Bretton Woods
System in 1971. Okay, so then you might ask, well, what
takes its place? Answer for a while: nothing really takes
its place. The currencies go into kind of a free float against each other, with no hard
anchor. That too contributes to the great
inflation and a lot of uncertainties in international trade, because currency values are fluctuating
more against each other.
In 1973-74 comes the first oil shock. There's a relatively small number of oil
producing countries as you can see from this map. In 1973, seizing on a political crisis
with another Arab-Israeli war in the Middle East, the oil producing
countries flex their muscles. They jack up the price of oil in a cartel. And that has reverberations, especially in the big oil importing
countries, but, by the way, will also affect all the countries in the
less developed world too. At the end of the 1970s, again picking up
off a scare caused by the Iranian Revolution of 1978 and 1979, oil prices
make another big jump. That rise in the prices of a key commodity
in the world economy also contributes to the Great Inflation. So it's worth taking a moment and just
reflecting on what all these sorts of problems would mean for
models of modernization like ISI. Remember, that was import-substitution industrialization, practiced by countries
like Brazil. Or export-oriented industrialization,
practiced by countries like Japan or South Korea. Or for the more socialist models. Why would this be trouble for an ISI-type
system? Well, you have to buy imports. You hope you can keep the amount of money you need to buy imports down, but if
you're importing a good amount of oil and the price of oil triples, you need more money to buy
that oil. Well, how are you going to get it? Because if the price of necessary imports goes up, and import substitution approach
doesn't have strong export products, you've sheltered your own domestic
industries from foreign competition, they're not producing their goods at a
price or quality that has had to be competitive in
foreign markets, so you can't rapidly ramp up your exports
in order to buy the oil you now need. What do you then do about that problem? You still need to buy the oil. You may even want to give your people more
subsidies, so they can pay those higher oil prices
without much domestic unrest. The answers are going to be, you're
going to start printing money to solve problems
like these. And the answer for a country like Brazil
then was increasingly endemic inflation leading to hyperinflation and a
breakdown in the value of Brazilian currency, and eventually, the
breakdown of Brazilian economic growth. Similar patterns were seen in other countries that had followed models like
this. Okay. So why would these economic troubles be a
problem for an export-oriented economy? Remember, these are economies that have depressed their domestic standard of
living in order to keep their exports cheap, in order to enrich the people, the
companies, that are making these exports and their allies
in the government. But what if problems in importing
countries like the United States, like Western Europe, means their
demand for import falls. Then you're, not only are you depressing
the living standards of your own people, you're taking in less money as
an offsetting compensation for that. Your political problems might get even worse. You can imagine greater tensions between
historic allies like the United States and Japan, the United States and South Korea, and that's definitely there during the
1970s. So, lots of economic troubles, including international economic tensions, what does
it mean? Fraying ties among allies, the
routinization of rivalries among enemies. Meanwhile in the early 1970s, the United States suffers the
appearance of a catastrophic failure, a defeat, in the
Vietnam War. The United States had gotten its troops
out of Vietnam. It had helped sign a treaty at the beginning of 1973, but the treaty breaks
down. Meanwhile, the fed up US Congress won't support more military assistance to South
Vietnam. North Vietnam overruns South Vietnam. The Vietnam War is over. It looks and feels like a huge American
defeat. It feels like American power is in
retreat, maybe in decline. The country is divided at home. Meanwhile, it looks to the outside world
like the Soviet Union is just getting stronger and
stronger in the 1970s. Although quietly, behind the scenes,
socialism is having some serious economic problems of its own. But, you might ask, isn't it a good thing
that the tensions between the Soviet Union and the
United States have relaxed? Didn't people feel like with this
relaxation of tensions, with detente, things were getting
much better? After all, the sides seemed to be
practicing a kind of peaceful coexistence. Here's Nixon and Brezhnev having regular
summit meetings, talking freely about each other's concerns. But what the world also has is a sense of
routine, managed conflict. For a sense of the peculiar balance in the
detente of 1972 between the Soviet Union and the United States, take a
look at this Time Magazine cover. This's 1972, so you have President Richard Nixon on the right, Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev on the left, and they're shaking hands. They're getting along, you see Nixon has
just received a whole suitcase bulging with money and
even an olive branch representing peace because
the Americans have just sold a whole lot of wheat to the hungry
Russians. Commercial relationships and friendship.
Now both men, as you see, have something hidden behind
their back. Just an armful of missiles and guns and
arrows, all the implements of war. Right there too. But they're trying to manage their
conflict, routinize their conflict. That fellow you see in the far right, that's the Democratic senator Henry
Jackson, called Scoop Jackson. He doesn't think the United States and the
Soviet Union should be getting along so well. He thinks the United States should be confronting the Soviet Union a little bit
more. But, they're going ahead with trying to
manage all of this. Two great powers trying to routinize their
rivalry. And you see things aren't all dismal in
the world: Time Magazine is calling attention to a
brand new invention, you see there in the bottom right hand corner,
these newfangled string bikinis. There are some obstacles to detente, to a
happy relaxation of tensions. Well, like what? Theyï¿½ll have some real problems in domestic
support for this. Well, why would that be a problem? Because the government is saying in
effect, well, you just need to be realistic. We're the two great powers. We need to just adjudicate these conflicts and disputes among us, that's the
realistic path. But on the one hand, it seems like you're betraying the ideals that your country is standing
for. And on the other side, it might look like,
yes, and you're making conflict and competition
a matter of accepted routine. And also the process and style in both
United States and Soviet Union of managing these super power conflicts and having
quiet discussions of how to sort things out, seemed
incredibly secretive, deceptive to the outside world. So there's a lot of domestic criticisms of
that. And it does tend to reinforce the argument
that, you know what, the two big superpowers are
kind of alike, and the rest of the world is trapped in
their rivalry and their little games. To give you some sense of the idealistic
argument, notice the way Time Magazine is calling attention
to the plight of these interesting Soviet intellectuals. Writers who are trying to expose the way
Soviet totalitarian rule has worked. Here in this cover story of 1968 on
Russia's dissident intellectuals, you see the ice
is slowly thawing. That's allowing the release of this numbered Soviet prisoner, Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn, who you see now portrayed almost as the lonely prophet, the Jeremiah of the Soviet
regime in 1974, writing a gigantic book on the Gulag Archipelago, exposing the Soviet
slave labor system, in which Solzhenitsyn had been a
prisoner. But domestic concerns, domestic unease
with this managed conflict regime, isn't the only
problem. Another problem is that it's hard for them
to really reduce the threat. For instance, the two sides have different
kinds of military forces. In Europe, Soviet army is much larger. But then that's supposed to be offset by
NATO advantages in technology, in nuclear
weapons. But NATO's defense strategy means that if the Soviets successfully attack and are
overrunning Western Europe, NATO has to be willing to be the
first countries to use nuclear weapons. So that seems like a kind of unstable way
of preserving the nuclear balance. Is the United States really willing to
risk a global nuclear war, to sacrifice Chicago to save Hamburg? There's also a nuclear asymmetry since the
arsenals of the two sides are different. The Soviets have a huge force of heavy
land based missiles, highly accurate. The Americans rely much more on their
bombers, on their submarines. So the Americans fear the Soviets have the temptation to strike first with their
highly accurate missiles. The Soviets fear that the Americans will
use their buildup at air and at sea to present them with a nuclear danger because after all,
doesn't NATO threaten to start a nuclear war if there is a war in
Europe? So my main point here is that the military balance might seem stable on the
surface, but to people who are looking at it in the governments of the two sides, it didn't
really seem all that stable. They still saw significant threats in the
dynamic of military competition. A third obstacle to getting a real
relaxation of tension that could bring the Cold War
to an end was the ongoing struggles in the Third World between the proxies of the two
sides. Both sides complaining that the other was
seeking unilateral advantage in the conflicts of the Middle East,
between Arabs and Israelis. In Indochina, even after North Vietnam won
its war and became the unified country of Vietnam, renaming Saigon into Ho Chi
Minh City, Vietnam finds itself in a conflict with
Chinese-dominated Cambodia. Vietnam even invades Cambodia, putting an
end to the genocide being conducted by that
communist regime. The Chinese, angrily, invade Vietnam from
the north and fight a brief inconclusive struggle there
in early 1979, so more fighting in Indochina.
And Africa is becoming much more of a theater for Cold
War proxy wars during the 1970s. In Southern Africa, there, for example, is
a civil war in the new country of Angola. In that civil war, the United States secretly backs one side, the Soviets secretly back
another. The Soviets escalate the play. Tens of thousands of regular Cuban troops
are airlifted into Angola, in order to make sure their preferred side
wins the civil war. In the Horn of Africa, which we see
depicted up here, there's also a new Cold War
contest. The ancient empire of Ethiopia had been
supported by the West in the 1970s, early 1980s. The Soviets were supporting a military dictatorship
here in Somalia, as the two sides were tussling over who
would control this region. Oh, but wait.
Socialists overthrow the emperor. There's a coup in which there's now a
pro-socialist government in Ethiopia. The Soviets and their Cuban and East
German allies switch sides. Thousands of Soviet and East European
military advisers flow into Ethiopia, now helping them fight Somalia, and the
Somalis are now getting help from the United
States. In Central America, a civil war inside Nicaragua also becomes a cold war proxy
conflict: one side getting help from the Cubans,
another side getting help from the Americans, and that civil struggle
then extends to El Salvador as well and rebellions against the brutal right
wing dictatorship in Guatemala long backed by the United
States. And finally, the 1970s conclude with the
Soviet invasion and occupation of the country of
Afghanistan. You might ask yourself for a moment, why
in the world would the Soviets want to invade and
occupy Afghanistan? Soviet allies had been in charge in
Afghanistan, but, for Afghan reasons, that had
degenerated into a civil war. The Soviets feared, irrationally it seems,
because there was no real factual basis for it, that the
Americans would take advantage of that civil war and
get involved in helping the other side in the
Afghan war. To preempt that kind of American
intervention, which hadn't even occurred, the Soviets
decide that to defend themselves, they need to invade and occupy Afghanistan, beginning
with a landing by Soviet paratroopers and the killing of
the Afghan head of state. But to the Americans and to a lot of the
world, the notion that the Soviets are doing this defensively, out of fear of an imaginary American intervention,
doesn't seem to make sense. They have their interpretation, which is
this is a part of an onward march of Soviet conquests that might even be headed
towards taking advantage of the turmoil in Iran and even moving towards the Persian Gulf. So to take stock of this, the domestic economic models are sputtering,
international tensions are getting a lot worse, and at home in these countries,
East and West, conditions deteriorate even more
in the 1970s. Let's take a look at how postwar boom is
turning into bust. Next time. [BLANK_AUDIO]
