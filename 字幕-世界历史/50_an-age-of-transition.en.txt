Hi.
Welcome back. In beginning the presentation today,
since this is the last presentation in the course, I wanted to take a moment before I dig
back into the history to pay a special tribute to the people who've help produce all these
presentations. This is the 97th video presentation
in this course on the Modern World, and every single one of them has been
filmed, post-produced, edited by Stace Carter. And every one of them has been put
together with the assembly of the media and images and the relevant
copyright work, and who knows what else, by Brandon Kist. So, since we don't tend to run a credits line at the end of each of our
presentations, I'm doing an in-person credits line here
and a shoutout to Stace Carter and Brandon Kist,
who have been key partners in the preparation of all these
presentations that you've been enjoying with me. So into An Age of Transition. That's the age that I think we're in right
now. As a motif for this presentation, here's a
painting by Caspar David Friedrich. The painting is from 1818. It's The
Wanderer Overlooking the Sea of Fog. So here's a hiker in the Saxon Mountains,
but, of course, the metaphorical image that's being
captured here is a little bit like the way we might feel having worked
through 250 years of history and now overseeing a vast but
murky terrain ahead of us. Let's start, though, by doing a little bit
of a review, by offering a very crude outline of the history we've
covered for the modern world. You could think of it as a history in
three phases. Phase One. Let's call this, again these are just
rough approximations, from about 1760 to, oh, about 1870 or so. Let's call that a phase of construction, a
phase of, rise of many things. It's the playing out of the Commercial and
the Military Revolutions. It's the rise of democratic, in some
cases, industrial nation states. It's the zenith of liberalism, but still alongside lots of traditional
institutions. So the classic advanced country might look
like a constitutional monarchy. 1760 to 1870, in other words, all these new
developments come into play.
Global networks encircling the world, even telegraph wires, steamship lines, the Suez
Canal was just being cut. So 1760 to 1870, all this new stuff comes
into play. In the middle of the century huge conflicts, global, local interactions,
American Civil War, Taiping Rebellion, Indian Mutiny or civil war, but settling
down by 1870. Then there's kind of an intervening transition.
I think of this transition as, in the 1870s and 1880s, as, in a way, all these new changes are being digested, processed, and turned into new global systems. Now modern global capitalism takes form.
Corporations. Multi-national corporations. Global financial system.
Gold standard. And the modern industrial nation states
turn into imperial nation states, with far flung
iron navies. And then that ushers in Phase Two, which we
could think of as running crudely from about 1890 to the 1990s.
Now all these new systems are in place and it's like there's a step function of
acceleration. Like we're moving out of first and second
gear, into third and fourth gear. The systems have been developed, building
on all these new technologies, these new
capabilities. It's been digested, and now it's moving
out. This period that I call, and following
other historians, even Lenin, the Great Acceleration, in the 25 years
between 1890 the outbreak of World War I.
An acceleration that helps trigger World War I.
But this is a century in which we see a great struggle over how to organize, and
cope with, these modern industrial societies.
This is a period in which we're developing such fantastic capabilities that the
capabilities are literally outrunning the ability of
slower moving human beings and slower evolving human minds to keep pace with the powers they are
building. So that by the 1940s human beings are already
building atomic explosives at a point where their brains can scarcely
comprehend what the appropriate uses are for such
colossal powers. But, the dangers posed by that period of kind of the sorcererï¿½s apprentice finding
that his creations have entirely gotten away from him, we are
able to keep from destroying the planet during
this period. We come to the brink a couple of times, the brink both morally and
geopolitically. But by the early 1990s, it seems to resolve
itself and a broad new consensus, a Great Convergence.
And so my argument a little bit to you, is, we may now be at
another transition phase in all of world history.
And then, if you're following my suggested template here, I'm postulating that we'll come out of this transition and move into some still undefined Third Phase.
The issues in this Third Phase, I argue, will
not look like the issues in the Second Phase.
In a way now, we have this convergence. A set of new systems.
New levels of interaction. New kinds of issues. And then as we see those problems and
address those problems, different kinds of structures and
opportunities and situations are going to dominate this coming age in
which all of you are going to take part.
So, that's my brief, broad outline in a nutshell.
Let me give you a little more detail. Letï¿½s suppose we were to analogize the
current Period of highly globalized economic and
political interaction and general world peace, though various
local conflicts, with a period like that earlier Great
Acceleration, say in the 1890s, early 1900s. Let's follow the analogy and see where it leads
us. There are some likenesses between the
present age and that earlier one a little more than a hundred
years ago. For example, now, like then, we have
relatively interchangeable money. We have a relatively wide-open
international financial system, punctuated by periodic financial
crises, as the money forces careen, back and forth.
Politics and ideas about governments are more dominated now, as they were then,
by relatively centrist ideologies, with almost all of them at least paying
lip service to liberal ideals. That again is pretty characteristic of the 1880s and 1890s. You'll remember my five originals for
modern political party ideologies, that family of
ideologies. There were three big ones kind of in the middle there and then a couple of
outliers. We have a period of relatively open trade
and safe seas. Continuing large demographic changes. It's relatively easy for people to move. It's not as easy now for people to move
across borders as it was back then. But there are still some significant
demographic changes going on. Fairly high levels of world economic
growth; a lot of that growth being concentrated in what
investment bankers like to call emerging markets. And with that high growth is coming widening inequality, because the people
who are benefiting the most from the growth are the people operating in the global
capitalist system, parlaying it into wealth for the assets
they control. So that now I've heard the phrase Gini
out of the bottle. Gini is referring to the G-I-N-I
coefficient, which is simply a way of measuring income
inequality in different societies. So, if your Gini coefficient is high, that
means you have high levels of inequality. So for example, China today, high levels
of economic growth, very high levels of
income inequality. Income inequality in China today,
nominally Communist China, is pretty similar to levels of income inequality in
say, Mexico today, a society that's long been marked by
notorious inequality. So Gini out of the bottle. Another commodity boom. You'd expect this in a period of intense
global economic interaction. A demand for commodities from all over the world to fuel factories in lots of
different countries. Commodity demand now coming out of China,
out of India, not just out of the quote, unquote,
developed countries. In this case, of course, a lot of the
desired commodities are things like oil, aluminum. The list of commodities that are a hot may
be a little different than what they were a
hundred years ago, but again it's a feature of the global
system. Global markets very strong. Just as education was being transformed
back then, with the rise of public schooling even at the
primary and secondary level, I think we're now seeing another
transformation of education. Maybe a tiny bit in courses like this. But also, the spread of global higher
Education: colleges, universities, morphing, taking
on new forms. But what are some of the differences
between that earlier age and the present one that we're
in now. One is, I think we're now in a period of a
global Rights Revolution. I argued in earlier presentation that this
Rights Revolution really seemed, to me, to be taking off during the 1960s
and 1970s. I followed, for instance, just the rise of
laws banning discrimination by private firms in
employment. Bans on discrimination based on color or
based on gender, extending into the private sector as a one marker
for a Rights Revolution. That's continuing. Not just the Rights Revolution in the assertion against discrimination based
on color, but, in some ways, the real frontier of
the Rights Revolution and a lot of the world today are still arguments
over the rights and opportunities and roles of
women in society. Recently, there was a terrible rape and
brutal assault in New Delhi, India that I want to tell you a
little bit about. This was a young woman coming from a poor
rural family. She was a relatively low caste Hindu.
She'd move to the big city. She was making money, she was getting
money back to her family, she was helping to pull her family
out of poverty. She had the goal of the becoming a
physical therapist. She was a relatively anonymous person in
the big city, so here, she, a relatively low caste Hindu is able to date
a boy who's a high caste Hindu. The kind of thing that in her rural
village might have been impossible. They're living the life of the new urban
society. But she's attacked by a gang of young men,
on an ill-protected bus in a sprawling big city that doesn't yet have
good enough police protection. Sheï¿½s badly brutalized,
dies from her injuries. For a lot of young people in India, this
crime seemed to them to symbolize how old India needed to
catch up with new India. Above all, and for example, respecting the
right and role of women. And so here huge demonstrations in the
city of New Delhi. You see these women climbing up the posts
on one of India's great wide boulevards for
parading in New Delhi. She and other colleagues are climbing up
all these posts, holding out their signs. My safety should not be a matter of
chance. They want a special degree of respect.
Those kind of assertions. Those kinds of issues seem to be a marker
of the present age. Also the communities are more globalized,
much more globalized now than they were then. People's identities now are not so much
caught up in local definitions. Right now, all of you watching this
presentation are part of a global community. Actually, often these communities are
virtual communities, we're linked to each other in virtual
kinships. As you are by participating in a class
like this one. Or, doctors scientists, lawyers, policemen
are all now linked in various kinds of virtual and
global associations. The hierarchies are now much less
international. Remember, more than a hundred years ago there
were great powers and then there were these imperial powers,
and there were colonies, and there was a very clear hierarchy of which states were on top, which states
were not. That hierarchy is not nearly as clear
today, sure there are some countries that are wealthier, and
some countries have larger armies, but in a way the stratification of
global society is more transnational. The divisions are those that cut across
societies, across countries, not so much between
them, between haves and have-nots, so that
wealthy people in China might feel more in common with wealthy people in the United
States in contrast with poorer people in both of their societies.
Another difference: Back then, power was concentrated because power
was industrial power. Power was in masses of men and metal, and
it took time to accumulate industrial power, to build
fleets of warships, assemble divisions of tanks.
Now power is much more diffuse, because power doesn't just take industrial
forms. And power is diffused at multiple levels
of scale. States, firms, gangs, even individuals can
all exert a variety of different kinds of power in the networked world we live in today, depending on what they're
working on. A group of people smaller than
what would make up an army platoon was able to kill
3,000 people in the United States on September 11, 2001
using a trivial amount of money. That's an example of diffusion of power.
Certainly in a negative sense. Of course positive power is much harder to
wield than negative power. It's much easier to knock things down than
it is to build them. Another difference from more than a hundred
years ago: a lot more interdependence. A lot more webs that make our complex multi-national systems dependent on each
other, as we saw in the financial crisis. As we see in a thing like, the Internet. The governance of the Internet itself is
murky and transnational. Lots of people can take advantage, lots of different states, firms, companies contribute to maintaining
it. Like the internet service provider that
you're utilizing to make this available to you. But no one company, no one state controls
the hardware and the capability. So, now let's study the transition in
global politics that comes out of this period of
transition and world history we're in right now. Now, at more of a political level, we can
call out three regions of the world that definitely seem to be in
intense period of transition. One is Southwest Asia and the Arab world,
including North Africa. As I mention in earlier presentation this
week, a lot of Southwest Asia is still going
through a period of transition, trying to find a consensus about how to govern and organize their
societies in a way that reconciles their traditional
norms, their Islamic ideals in some cases, with the
challenges of modernity. I don't think that's been figured out yet,
so there's a lot of political transition going on in Southwest
Asia and it may be accompanied by violence, perhaps even quite dangerous
violence. There's also transition going on in South Asia, India itself is undergoing
significant instability. Not so much huge internal violence, though
there is a little bit of that, just more the challenge of maintaining public
order at the local ground level in a situation where social demands are
outstripping the capacity of government to address those demands in
many ways. And India is a relatively stable country, still a relatively resilient federal
democracy with strong state governments. But go up north and you look at Pakistan in danger of becoming an utterly
failed state, or a country like Afghanistan or
Bangladesh, and we can see that South Asia is going to be an enormous
transitional region touching what will happen to more than a billion people. Northeast Asia. This is interesting, because I think that
even putting aside a country like North Korea, I'd argue that China is
still a country in transition. I don't think the Chinese leadership,
themselves, are sure exactly what their country is
going to look like even 10 years from now, much
less 20 or 30 years from now. The political economy of China, I think, is deeply contested. They're
absorbing a generation of enormous change. How that's going to play out, I'm just not
sure about. I can make a positive story, I can make up
a negative story. We know the way it turns out is going to
be really important either way. But another place in Northeast Asia that I
think is worth particular attention, not just the success
story of South Korea, or the tragedy of North Korea, but look at Japan. Japan's the third
largest economy in the world. There are a lot of dismal
forecasts about Japan: that it's demographically problematical,
because they won't allow immigrants, its population is aging,
economic prospects seem dismal. But if you study history, and you study
Japanese history, then you should know not to underestimate the capacity of Japan to
change, and change pretty darn rapidly. I don't know how Japanese society will
react to the challenges that it faces. I just know that historically, Japan will
go through periods in which it will seem stagnant, but then once
the Japanese decide that they need to change, they can turn on
a dime. I don't know how they may decide to
address their demographic issues, it's going to be really interesting to figure out, but obviously,
what Japan and China decide to do over the next
10 or 20 years is going to be enormously
consequential for the rest of the world. But, don't just think about the
geopolitics of Asia. Let's think about another way of slicing
into global politics. If you were to ask yourself or post on a
discussion forum: What are the kinds of issues that
are most likely to determine the course of world history
over the next 40, 50, 60 years, they might be issues like
some of these, where I think foreign policy has eroded in its
importance. Let me give you an illustration of what I
mean: The future of global capitalism is
obviously pretty important. So what kind of policies will determine
the fate of global capitalism? You say, well, domestic economic policies,
largely, but not really, you know, many ways, our domestic economic
policies are just the local face of a global phenomenon.
For example, in your country probably, like in my country, we have to
set policies to run our banking system. But can any one country set policies for its banking system in isolation from all
the others? Why no. Well then who sets things like oh, capital
adequacy requirements for banks? What are the cash reserves do
banks need to keep on hand so, that they don't have to be bailed out
if they get in trouble? Well that turns out to be something like a
G7 or G20 financial stability forum, kind of a semi-governmental group that
gets together and sets policies for leading banks among
leading countries. So is that a foreign policy, or is it an
accumulation of domestic policies? And my answer is, neither of the above. The neat division between, well, this is
domestic, and this is foreign is breaking down when you look at a
problem as to how we address the future of global
capitalism. But the division between domestic and
foreign policy breaks down again when you look at this
problem: energy and natural resources. Surely the availability of energy and availability of fundamental natural
resources is going to have a big effect on world history over the next 40
or 50 years. We've relied on relatively infinite
natural resources of many kinds for almost all of human
history. Without being a doomsayer, and knowing that
a lot of people that have been doomsayers have
been proven wrong, I think it is fair to say that we are
actually beginning to approach finite limits in some natural
resources that then require some sort of cooperative stewardship in this
phase of world history that's coming. Well let me just give you an example: say fresh water, a necessity of life that we certainly take for granted until, of course, we don't
have it. You can see that, as climate change
continues, increasing stresses on the availability of fresh water throughout a
very large part of the world, in this chart prepared by that National Intelligence Council Global
Trends Report. You could say well we can generate more
fresh water because we can develop technologies for desalination of
saltwater, but desalination of saltwater is incredibly
energy intensive, As the Saudi Arabian government knows, for
example, where its largest cities survive on the desalination
of salt water. So you then you see, then we need a lot of
energy supplies in order to make up for deficits of
naturally occurring freshwater. And meanwhile, the consumption of energies
in the form of fossil fuels, is helping to
accelerate the tempo of the very climate change that is putting stress on the fresh water
supplies. Now, my only point about all of this is,
suppose you think this is a problem that requires
some cooperative work. How does that work get done? Can any one country solve these problems,
these mixed problems of energy and the stewardship of
natural resources? Even things like, how many fish are
available in the sea, or how to manage increasingly
large fish farms? If no one country can manage this, how do
we manage this together? Because usually, this is considered a
subject for domestic policy. But clearly, none of these problems can be resolved, meaningfully, without a huge
amount of international cooperation. Or take the problem of the rise of ultra-
hazardous technologies. This phrase, ultra-hazardous, I get from
American tort law, but I think it's a useful phrase. Give you an example of an ultra-hazardous
technology. How about nuclear power that uses a manmade element like
plutonium? Talk about an ultra hazardous ingredient.
But what about nanotechnology? What about the capacity for the
manipulation of the human genome? We might see that genetic manipulation
offers a lot of wonderful capabilities for the human
future, or the animal future, but surely we can see some ultra-hazardous
potentials in the ability to manipulate the human
genome. You ask yourself: How do you manage that
problem? Can any one country manage it alone? Obviously, not, obviously, you need to
work together. Is that a foreign policy issue? Or is that a conglomeration of domestic
policy issues? And, of course, the answer is both. Ditto for transnational crime and public
order. We've been reading, of course, in recent years about the threat of international
terrorism, violent Islamist extremist groups. But, more people have been killed in
Mexico by transnational criminal gangs Than have lost their lives from violent,
Islamist extremism in the last few years, in both Iraq and
Afghanistan put together. Or, if you look at a part of the world
like West Africa, you can study a chart like this one,
produced by the World Bank. Over the last 20 years or so, you can see the scale of transnational criminal
and communal involvements in these areas of West Africa:
cocaine trafficking, diamond smuggling, timber smuggling from
illicit harvests, oil smuggling,
some offshore piracy preying on vessels. With which state are we at war here? There
is no state with whom we are at war. This obviously is not a domestic criminal problem, but it mostly
presents itself as a criminal problem in states that have
domestic police forces. Again, neither foreign policy nor domestic
policy, but both. The same is true for all the issues that
we confront when we think about the plight of the bottom billion that I talked about in a recent
presentation. They need changes in their domestic
Governance, but the outside world can either be
indifferent to their fate and will be affected by their fate, if we
ignore it. But what is the role of the outside world? Heavy-handed, paternal intervention, unwanted, resisted from
foreigners? Maybe not. Not a new imperialism. But indifference and abstention doesn't
seem like the right answer either. So, then, if we see a blurring of domestic
and foreign policy, as we increasingly
confront problems that are defined by their transnational character, not one
of blocs of rival powers, the kind of way we thought about foreign
policy issues for the last 350 years, if the new range of foreign policy issues have this peculiar
domestic/foreign character, what are governance institutions that then
must arise to address those challenges? Remember that last period of historical
transition in the 1800s. We didn't have governance institutions
for an international financial system like to manage a gold exchange standard
or to manage a new telegraph or the
proliferation of steamships and ports and standards for steamships and
on and on. We built and created institutions that were functional for helping us provide
governance for all these new activities. We're going to be experiencing in this
transition period more governance gaps. So, for example, we have nation states,
they're all powerful, but I'm not arguing that the nation state
is unimportant. I'm merely saying that they're
insufficient to be able to act to address all the kinds of problems
that I've described. Alright, suppose they need to cooperate. Am I going to build a grand international
organization that will sit on top of everyone to manage our energy supplies, our natural
resources, some kind of super government, world
government? Pause. Remember, we've seen that global local
interaction. I build that far away government, and I give that power to change my local
primary community. The local communities are going to push back. So you have to balance distant management,
frameworks of remote cooperation, against the desire for governance and
rights and voice from primary communities. That can't be a bunch
of remote technocrats, bureaucrats in some far-away organization with an
acronym that no one understands. How do you connect, then, distant management with local communities?
That's a governance gap. But, I don't want to make it seem hopeless. You can see now models of the way we are
building networked communities,
networked forms of governance, the Internet being a kind of primeval
example of it. Maybe there are new models for community
governance that are taking shape, enabled by technology. Another interesting model to keep in mind
is that of confederations. Remember I defined confederations back in
the 1950s and talked about leagues of states
pursuing common goals. We have a remarkable period of world
history today in which on any given day, you can imagine any one of the great
powers cooperating with each other on one or another issue. Perhaps, they form networks of
cooperation dedicated to one issue or another, where they work
together, and we see these interesting governmental
forms developing in places like Europe, where the European Union is
novel kind of confederation that still leaves lots of authority to
primary nation states. You can see within the European Union moves to create even more micro
communities, like an independent Scotland for example,
that movement, or a movement to create an independent Catalonia out of present day
Spain, but then that, or other examples, might
coexist with a European Union at various layers of governance interacting with each
other, with certain common goals. I don't know what the answer is going to
be, I just find it fascinating that we're in this period of
transition at a moment in world history, this is so much more interesting than the
Cold War era I grew up in, in which it seemed like the world was frozen into
rival warring geopolitical camps. Now world history seems to be going through another fluid period again, full
of possibility, full of uncertainty. I feel in a way like all of us are
wanderers overviewing the sea of fog. But I guarantee you, that we'll do a much
better job of surveying the path ahead enabled by knowledge of the history of
what has gone before. Thanks for joining me in this course on
the Modern World.
