Hi, welcome back. In this presentation, I wanted to focus on
the first two years of World War I. The basic message is that all the really elaborate plans to win the war are
failing. Vast plans moving millions of men, huge
amounts of artillery and ammunition, careful railway timetables, comes to bloody wreckage. The war starts out, though, with a great
sense of social unity, all those terrible political
arguments of the preceding 20 years, management versus working class and so on,
now seen replaced by a new kind of unity, as countries rallied
to their flags. But the war unfolds in ways that none of
the combatants had expected. What did they expect? You might ask. Well, mostly what people expect in the
future is things that they know have happened in the
past. They tend to predict the future with
analogies to the past. If they'd looked at other wars in the
past: the Russo-Japanese War lasted about a year and a half to two
years; the Franco-Prussian War lasted about a
year or so; the Crimean War, again relatively short. No one had any experience in their
lifetimes of a large-scale war that lasted year after
year after year. It was expected that there would be a
violent clash of armies, intense warfare, and a
quick outcome. That's not what happened. A key decision at the very outset of the
war is: What to do about Belgium? The creation of a neutral Belgium had
been a linchpin of European politics ever since
the 1830s. France and Germany both had to decide who
would enter Belgium to try to gain more
advantage from that. Principally, it was the Germans that
decided that they would really conduct the invasion of
Belgium to get the high ground. Knowing that would surely bring the
British in, on the French side. The British decision to join the war,
after the invasion of Belgium, it might have
happened anyway. It was unlikely the British were just
going to let the French be defeated, but the German invasion of Belgium, was
the pivot point for the British decision. But the German decision to invade Belgium
did not bring them success in the West. Let's look a little bit about, how the
initial weeks of the war unfolded. I'm greatly aided here by a wonderful
interactive map that's been created by the Public Broadcasting Service, in
conjunction with some of their work. Let's zoom in on this interactive map. Step one is the Germans break into the
Belgian forts to penetrate into Belgium, in order to
wheel down in France. The French are launching their own attacks,
against the German frontier. Those attacks collapse in bloody failure. The combatants are discovering that the
power of modern weapons, machine guns,
artillery, are simply devastating, when men in cavalry
stand up and charge out in the open. The German armies in Belgium sweep down
from the north, heading toward Paris. A lot of the standard works refer to this German plan, as the so called
Schlieffen plan. What the German attack was meant to do
was to provide an effective offensive move against France, as France had its own offensive plan against the German
frontier. Meanwhile in the East, the Russians
launched their attack, by two separate armies, against
German East Prussia. But the Germans counterattack and defeat the Russian
armies. Back in the West, the French rally a
defense near Paris, at what would be called the
Battle of the Marne, and the French defeat the
overextended German armies, who have now outrun their
overextended supply lines, because these modern armies now require
huge logistical support. In the next months of 1914, the different
sides settle into this line. And this line, will define what was called the Western Front for
the next years of war. Failures in the West are accompanied by
failures in the East. The Russians launch their offensives here,
against East Prussia, here against Austria; they don't
get very far. The Serbians drove forward into Bosnia,
but there's a counter attack from the Austrians, backed by the
Germans, eventually assisted by Bulgarian allies.
Serbia itself is occupied by the Central Powers; the battle line by the end of
1915 running down here. By the end of 1914, and into 1915, the war
begins widening pretty rapidly. Japan, a treaty ally of the British, join
in on the British side. They use this as an opportunity to occupy
German territory on the Chinese mainland: the whole Shandong
Peninsula and Qingdao. The Japanese also occupied German held
islands in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Empire, under the
leadership of its Turkish ruler, joins with Germany and Austria and
Bulgaria to form a united front. The Ottoman Empire and its Muslim rulers
declare a holy war, a jihad, against the British and
French and all their positions in the Middle
East, and the war quickly extends to a battle for
colonies: colonies especially in Africa, where both the British and the Germans mount
expeditionary forces to fight wars against each other
in the jungles. So, to give you some sense of scale of the
war in Europe and Southwest Asia: By the end of
1915, Germany and its allies are dominating this whole area of Central
and Southeastern Europe, going on into Southwest Asia, with the
Russians and the French, with British help, pushing against
them on both sides. And the British now especially involved in
battles against the Turks in Asia. With the British reaching out for help
from potential local allies, like say the Arabs, the
war is widening in other ways, too. In 1915, the combatants begin using the
new marvels of chemistry against each other in other
ways, releasing many tons of poison gas that, when inhaled,
will cause the lungs to inflame and asphyxiate
people in the thousands. As all the soldiers begin finding that
gas masks are part of their standard kit, the Germans
are also advancing in their use of submarines to disrupt
world trade and offset some of the British naval
advantages. So in early 1915, all the sides had
realized that their initial plans at the outbreak of war have
not ended the war. And they all start developing their
war-winning plans for 1915. Okay, they've learned their lessons,
they're going to mount huge offensives on the Western Front to now
break through and settle things in France. In the case of the Allies, they develop a big plan to break through that German,
Austrian, Bulgarian, Turkish combine by attacking right near
Constantinople and putting a huge landing force, especially using
Australian and New Zealand troops, to land at a place called Gallipoli, then move
from there to threaten Constantinople, knock
Turkey out of the war. They've all these elaborate plans. And in the spring and summer of 1915, all
of these plans fail, too. The offensives in France collapse into
bloody ruin, with the casualties lists beginning to amount into the hundreds
of thousands after these weeks of fighting. Both sides now realizing
that theyï¿½re straining their industry to simply produce enough shells to now
wage these sorts of modern battles. Then Gallipoli attack against the Turks
encounters a quite modern and very determined Turkish army
that kills the Australian, New Zealand, and British
Attackers in the tens of thousands and eventually hundreds of
thousands of casualties. As the powers on both sides realize that
they're involved in a prolonged world war, their war aims
evolve, too. Again, think back: What was the war initially about? It was initially about this rivalry in the
Balkans. But once these countries were fully at war, once so many of their citizens are
fighting and dying on such a colossal scale, well you have to develop war aims that will
somehow match. The Allies begin moving toward war aims, that will dismantle the
Austro-Hungarian Empire. Dismantle the Ottoman Empire. Germans and their allies developed equally
vaulting war aims. They're now developing ambitions that are
so radical that each side sees this almost as wars for their
future existence. Okay, so they had their big plans in 1915;
their plans failed. Well, they're going to learn the lessons
of 1915. They're going to develop still better
plans for 1916 that fully understand these conditions of modern war.
Both sides develop huge elaborate plans for war winning
offensives in 1916. In the case of both the Allies and the Germans, their plans center on the
Western Front. The Germans plant to launch an offensive
at a point the French are going to have to
defend. The Germans don't think that winning the
territory wins the war. No, they deliberately set out to wage a
battle in which they will bleed the French army
to death. They'll wage such a war of attrition that
the French Nation won't be able to stand to continue
the war. They pick as their site for that attack,
that blood bath, a place called Verdun. Meanwhile in 1916, they plan to greatly
expand submarine warfare, including sinking ships that transit in
the Atlantic between Britain and the raw
materials in America, in the hope that that will help
knock Britain out of the war, as well. The Allies, for their part, are developing
huge offensive plans of their own. The British will take the lead, focusing
on a place called the Somme. The battle for Verdun begins in February
of 1916. It goes on virtually the entire year. The hopes for a bloodbath are realized,
but the attrition runs both ways. Enormous losses of life within this
relatively tiny place. I've spent some time at Verdun; it's one
of the saddest places you can visit on the
planet. There are places of the landscape that are
so blasted by the fighting, that the vegetation still
hasn't recovered to this day. To this day, you can still see the way the earth has
been re-molded by the shell fire. You can see the gigantic cemeteries and
tombs of the soldiers who died there, under
nightmarish conditions. About a million French and German soldiers are consumed in the Verdun
maelstrom. The submarine war is effective but not
effective enough. The United States, which has stayed out of
the war, warns the Germans that, if they sink
American shipping and interfere with American
trade, the United States will join the war on the side of the British and
the French. The Germans hold back. So, the German
offensive plans fail. The Allies had their offensive plans, too. The lead part was that the Russians were
going to launch a gigantic offensive aimed at knocking the
Austrians out of the war. The offensive is very successful; it hits
the Austrians very hard, but it ends up hurting the Russian
army just as bad. The result: another inconclusive outcome. And as for the offensive on the Somme, one
of the most famous disasters of the entire war. The British attackers suffered
60,000 casualties, 20,000 British soldiers killed, just on
the very first day of the battle: July 1st, 1916. So in other words, every side has tried
its grand bid to win the war, and every side has
realized that none of it is working. All the plans have failed. In each of the Allied capitals, especially
among the leaders, who have the best information on what's really going
on, they can feel the strain now. The losses, the costs, are simply
enormous. Their economies, their finances,
everything is being strained to the limit. They're all thinking about: Where is this
going to go now? How can we win the war? And that creates a really interesting moment,
between about August 1916 and January 1917, when a lot of
things were possible, a crossroads that we'll discuss in the
next presentation.
