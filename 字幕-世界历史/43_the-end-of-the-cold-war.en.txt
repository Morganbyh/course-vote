Hi, welcome back. This presentation is on the end of the
Cold War. It's a period that means a lot to me
personally. I was a career diplomat at the time the Cold War ended and was working in the
White House and was involved in a lot of this
diplomacy and then later wrote a book about some of it. So, this is a near and dear period to me, and actually a pretty happy period in
world politics. It begins in the late 1980s. Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, they are
genuinely relaxing the tensions between the superpowers. Not just managed conflict, as between
Nixon and Brezhnev, this is a real dï¿½tente, and that sense of relaxed tensions is
making Gorbachev an enormously popular and admired person all
over the world in early 1989. Indeed there's really a widespread sense that the Cold War is over. That Cold Warrior, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, actually uttered those words, the Cold War is over, toward the end
of 1988. Reagan's Secretary of State, George
Schultz, also said: The Cold War is over. Think a little bit about what that would
mean, though, inside the communist system. This is a system that relied on revolutionary discipline, even the
discipline, if necessary, to imprison and kill subordinates, if that was need to
maintain the rule of the Party. Well, if this is true, then, why do I need to do this?
And, in particular, why would I need to kill people to do that?
So let's go to the spring 1989, a dynamic period, the dynamism is really kicked off
in Poland in March and April of 1989. The Polish military dictatorship, ruling
under martial law through the 1980s, decides that the time is right to try to rehabilitate its communist
government, picking up on some of the signals they're
getting from the Soviet Union. They reach out to negotiate with the
Polish opposition. They create a round table conference to
work on terms for sharing power. This is a wonderful photograph of the
Polish opposition leaders, led by this man, Lech Walesa, arriving for
a meeting literally of the round table, getting ready to take their seats. You just get that sense of hard pressed
men now wearing their suits and ties to sit down and work out the
future of a new Poland. At that roundtable negotiation, they
prepare an agreement for elections to be held in June 1989. The ruling Communist Party thinks that
they can frame and manage the outcome of this limited election. They'll only allow a certain number of
seats to be in play. They think they can keep the non-communist
opposition safely confined. It doesn't work out that way. They can't control the outcome of that
process. The non-communist electoral turnout is so
overwhelming, the mandate so clear, that it becomes obvious that very soon, the Polish
government is going to have to yield and allow the government to be taken
over by the non-communist opposition. That will unfold later in the summer of
1989. In China, too, springtime in 1989 is full of
promise. Remember I talked about Fang-Shou cycles,
loosening, tightening? Well, China was going through a cycle of
loosening in the late 1980s and momentum was building in early
1989 to carry it further. Thousands and thousands of students and
other Chinese gathered in the great ceremonial
square in the heart of Beijing, Tiananmen Square, to call for liberalization of China's
politics. Indeed, this wonderful photograph that
captures the thousands of people assembled in the
squares. The banners they're flying. They even built a paper mache statue
called the Goddess of Democracy, which you see there facing the
traditional portrait of Mao. The leaders of this movement are young
people, actually, people like a lot of you. This young man over here shown at the time
of early 1989. His name is Wang Dan.
He's in his early 20s. This young woman here, Chai Ling, 23 years
old. But, spring turns to warmer summer. In China, the conservative leadership,
after a period of intense deliberations, decides that the
problem is getting out of hand. The protestors' demands just continue to escalate, the leadership finally decides
the only thing it can do is to reassert its
authority and violently clear the Square. Sunday, June 4, 1989. This is of course the iconic image as the
tanks begin rolling in, but I'm afraid that young man isn't
able to stop the tanks. This is a glimpse of the scene in Tiananmen Square
itself. At the very back there you can see the
portrait of Mao that helps orient you to that photograph
you saw a moment ago. The debris from where the protesters had
been camped out, as armored cars and soldiers now control
the Square. But at almost the exact same time, Poland and Hungary in Europe are making some
different choices. The Pols are negotiating elections that will be
held in July 1989. Solidarity, the dissident movement, wins
those elections so decisively that the Polish government
feels obliged, by August 1989, to bargain a way for a non-communist
government to take power. The Soviets aren't sure what to do about
that. They insist that communists at least
control the security ministries, that Poland stay
in the Warsaw Pact military alliance, but Gorbachev decides to go along with it that
summer of '89 in Poland. In Hungary, the communist government in
Hungary decides to open its borders and allow its people to travel
freely to the West. Here is a bit of the scene as they can
begin crossing the borders to Hungary. Why are the Pols and Hungarians doing this? The communist governments did not want to
end communism. They thought they could manage these
problems, humanize the way they ran their communist
states, maybe even sidling towards something that
looked like democratic socialism. One side effect of what happened here in
Hungary though, is that East Germans, trapped in a state that did
not want reform, start fleeing from their country to the fellow communist
country Hungary. They can travel freely to another
communist country. But then when they travel to Hungary, they start trying to flee to the West through
Hungary. It puts incredible pressure on Hungary. Then, when they start trying to choke that
off, that flow of German refugees, then they turn to
Czechoslovakia in September 1989. When the East German government finally closes off the pathways even to
Czechoslovakia, increasingly East Germany is turning
itself, the whole country, into a prison camp, even keeping
its people from travelling to other communist
countries in an effort to somehow avoid the tidal wave of
reform. But notice the different choices being
made here. Poland and Hungary are making choices
towards liberalization and openness. The Chinese, at almost the same time, make
a different kind of choice in favor of shutting down
reform, using violence if needed. Why, then, are these different choices
being made in these different countries? Partly it's because the Polish and
Hungarian leaderships thought they could manage the
change. The Chinese leadership thought they could
not manage it. They were frightened of it, and they
decided to use violence to stop it. That Chinese option, that Chinese solution
as people called it in 1989, is going to come right into the inbox of
the East German leaders in October 1989. Escalating demonstrations
in their country, probably the climactic one was in early October 1989 in
the city of Leipzig. Here's the scene. Thousands of people gathering. The government knows this protest is going
to happen. What are they arguing for, these
protesters? Well, here's another snapshot from the
protest. You can look at some of their banners,
they're interesting. Take this one, for example, in the middle. Coca-Cola, is that all? That's not an anti-American protest, what
they're saying in effect is the East German government is
just trying to buy us off by bringing in some material goods. They think if we can get a can of
Coca-Cola, we're going to be happy. But here what
they're talking about that's a banner that reads: Political
independence for study, teaching, research. Or here, and I'll just
translate this very loosely: It doesn't always have to be a darkness at
noon. Is the dawn coming? Well the East German leadership thought
hard about what to do about this Leipzig
protest. They developed an option for militarily
crushing it, the Chinese solution. Even to the point of having allocated all
the hospital beds that would be needed for the people that
would be injured. They'd gathered the security forces,
they're ready to do it. Why didn't they do it then? It's a terrific question, I can give you
three reasons. One, increasingly the aging communist
leadership was reluctant to kill people for the
revolutionary cause. A basic change in hearts and minds from
the political ideas that seemed so commonplace for hardened figures and
politics on either side, say in the 1920s or 1930s. Two: They looked at their options, they
said one option could be Chinese solution. Crush this. Another option could be well maybe we
should just have a reform communism in our
country. Indeed maybe what we should do in East
Germany is just imitate what Gorbachev seems to be doing so
successfully in the Soviet Union. Very important, the belief that what
Gorbachev was doing was working, would then help to stay their hand
in crushing this. Third. When they glanced at the Soviet
Union, and Said: What do you think if we use
violence? The Soviet Union ostentatiously kept its
distance. The Soviet Politburo thinks about it and decides not to crush the
demonstration. And at that point, it's clear that East German leadership is going to have to
change. They do change their leadership. They adopt a new communist leadership very
much in the model of Gorbachev, and Soviets help that process along. Here's another scene from October, 1989,
celebrating the 40th anniversary of East Germany, the
German Democratic Republic. There's Gorbachev standing next to the aging East German Prime Minister, Erich
Honecker. As you can see, Gorbachev is looking at
his watch, as if he's wondering how much time
Honecker has left. Answer: not much. A few weeks later, Honecker will be gone
and the new reformed communist government is trying to think of ways to
satisfy the people and make them happy. One of the ministers gets up in a late night press conference in early
November 1989 and says you know what, we're going to loosen
the rules on how you could travel to the West. And then he goes home. All the people
watching him on TV think: What does it mean that he just said this, can we now
travel to the West? Tens of thousands of people in the middle of the night begin rushing towards the
Berlin Wall. Now, he didn't mean to open up the Berlin
Wall, but all those people are rushing to the Wall and the border guards
have no instructions on what to do. Thousands more arrive. The border guards are asking themselves,
should we shoot, we have no orders to shoot, we don't know what the Minister
meant in his press conference either. Finally, they shrugged their shoulders,
give way, people swarm over the wall, and you have these amazing scenes, like the one, here,
at the Brandenburg Gate in the heart of
Berlin. Or this one here, or here, as the border guards themselves were
gazing in some bemusement. The world sensed a historical moment had
arrived. There was an earthquake, but what would
the new Europe look like? The American president, George H.W Bush,
had been arguing since May 1989, that Europe ought to become a Europe
whole and free. He'd been arguing, even in September and October of 1989, that the goal ought to be a unified Germany,
echoing the kind of things that American statesmen
had talked about in the late 1940s and early
1950s. At the end of 1989 and early 1990, the
United States and the West German government, led by Helmut Kohl, rally some
very reluctant West Europeans, who are afraid of a
reunified Germany, to support unification as the
goal for a reconstructed Europe. To be able to manage that process of
unification, they developed an international
negotiation called the Two Plus Four. The two: East and West Germany; the four:
the four powers, United States, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union,
who have vestigial occupation rights, because you know, a peace treaty was never signed with
Germany. So the old military occupation rights,
dating from World War II, still have to legally resolved, and then combine that, with an internal negotiation of
unification. Article 23 was a particular provision in
the German constitution that they called their
Basic Law. By the way, they called it their Basic Law
because it was meant to be an interim document since a constitution couldn't be
prepared until there was a unified Germany to work on it. There were a couple of different concepts
for unification out there. One was a merger, East and West Germany
negotiate common terms for how they will be governed
together. Instead, what the West Germans decide,
with American backing, it should be a takeover. East Germany should simply be submerged
into West Germany. What's the advantage of a takeover? You don't have to negotiate a new kind of
German state. Germany had had some troubles with developing republics during the 20th
century. Look, if you've got a republic that's
working, why invent a new one? That was the logic of early 1990.
That was the issue given to East German voters in March
of 1990. West German political parties develop
partner parties in East Germany putting up
election posters like this one, from the Christian Democratic Partyï¿½s partner in
East Germany, saying: No more socialism. Say yes to
freedom and prosperity. Of course, on the other side of the
argument, it looked like West Germans, with their financial and political power,
were preparing a state treaty, that's what Helmut Kohl is holding in
this caricature, to which the little East German prime minister, a man named de Maiziï¿½re, is clearly just a subordinate
figure. But one of the West German appeals is
That, if there is a merger, East Germans get to have West German money, and their East
German deutschemarks can be exchanged for West German deutschemarks one to one. 
That's what the Germans choose to do. This photograph captures the moment at
which literally physically bundles and bundles of West German
deutschemarks are brought into the East German banks and are
unwrapped in order to hand out the new money to East
Germans. As you can see, these bank employees are viewing this as a pretty interesting and
happy occasion. During 1990, the surge towards German
unity isn't occurring in isolation. Vast arms control treaties are being
negotiated to accompany it, including the largest and most ambitious
arms control treaty every signed, concluded in the fall
of 1990, to reduce the conventional forces on both
sides. But that's not all. Germany, wanting to reassure West European
countries about what will happen if Germany becomes
unified, also supports tighter European integration.
So, you see this image in which Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Jacques Delors, 
you remember him, are looking at the map of a new European community
that will include a unified Germany.
NATO and the Warsaw Pact, those military alliances confronting each other in the
most militarized part of the world, are working out their differences, signing
the arms control treaty that I mentioned, so that this division of Europe
increasingly is fading away, and very soon, these
countries will begin leaving the Warsaw Pact and that whole military organization will
start to disintegrate. You know, looking back on this period, everything happened so quickly, it might
just seem like a damn broke and the water burst
through. And the main reason I'm trying to spend
some time unpacking all of this is because, of course, it's an immensely important period in world
history. But I just want you to see that it's actually made up of a series of really
important choices made by governments in their
international relations and in their domestic politics crowded
together in a tumultuous period. By the spring and summer of 1990, those choices were coming back to the Soviet
Union itself. After all, if you've given up the coercive
principle that we're not going to hold people together by force, gee what does
that mean for the Soviet Union? Because remember, what does Soviet Union
mean anyway? It means that they're a series of
different countries, socialist republics, united in
a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Itï¿½s a principle that says we had a Russian
Empire that simply ruled over all these
subordinate nationalities. We've replaced a Russian Empire with a
Soviet Union.
And the veneer, of course, is that all these people are voluntarily united by
their solidarity as fellow communists, as fellow
socialist republics. The reality, of course, as some of these
nationalities had experienced, is that it felt to them like they were living
in a Soviet Empire. If the coercive principle breaks down,
what happens then to that whole political entity of the
Soviet Union? This map gives you a sense of the
complexity of the Soviet Union. There is a federation inside the union, a Russian Federation, which itself is a
federal republic. And then a series of other autonomous
republics, Kazakh, Uzbek, Turkmen, Kyrgyz, and so on, including these here in the
western part of the Soviet Union. What's going to happen?
Of course, it's all ruled from the center, from Moscow, but these events in
1989 and 1990 are placing enormous stress
inside the center. Gorbachev's leadership is being powerfully
challenged by people who are now alarmed by what's going on. They especially see that some of the
republics in the Soviet Union themselves are demanding
the right to secede. No republic was more in the forefront of those demands than Lithuania, bordering
the Baltic Sea. They had a crisis over Lithuania in May
1990, the Soviet Union begins cutting off vitally
needed energy supplies to Lithuania to try to bring them back into
the line, but the issue is: Are they willing to use
force? Are they willing to kill a lot of Lithuanians to keep Lithuania inside the
Soviet Union? The international community, of course, is urging Gorbachev not to use force.
There are hectic debates when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union holds
its party congress in August of 1990. Gorbachev is challenged in particular by
this man, Yegor Ligachev, a party leader from
Moscow. He wonders where all this is going to go. Gorbachev increasingly abandons the
practices of relying on collective leadership among the whole party Politburo. He concentrates more and more authority in
his hands and the circle around him. He does that partly so that he can bring
the German issues to a conclusion and sign the
German settlements, first in this deal concludec with the West
Germans in July of 1990 in the Caucasus. There is Gorbachev, his wife, Raisa,
Helmut Kohl, and his foreign minister, the Liberal Party leader, Hans Dietrich
Genscher. And then in the international agreement,
the final settlement on Germany. I actually participated in these
negotiations, and here's the American team signing that agreement in Moscow in
September 1990. By the way that young woman right there is
named Condi Rice. In early October 1990, Germany is celebrating its peaceful unification. Here are the crowds gathered in front of
the disused German Parliament Building, the old Reichstag, what will become the
seat of a new, unified Bundestag, with this emblem representing the German
people. But back in the Soviet Union, the Moscow
center is splitting, polarizing. Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard
Shevardnadze, this man right here, he warns the Americans: The dictatorship
is coming. In January 1991, there is another phase in
the Lithuanian crisis. Gorbachev is on the verge of declaring
national martial law, using force to crush the dissidents; he
holds back though. Bottom line he, Gorbachev, is not going to accept massive bloodshed, a Chinese
solution, to hold these republics in line. From that moment on, the process of
disintegration accelerates. Now as you can see from this map, the Soviet Empire in East Europe already
is splintering. All of these countries beginning to find
their own way. Germany reunifying in the fall of 1990. Really the remarkable thing is that,
except in the overthrow of the communist
dictatorship in Romania, this is accompanied by almost no bloodshed. In August 1991, the military, the right
wing, try to overthrow Gorbachev in order to institute martial law and
hold the Soviet Union together. The coup is defeated, not so much by
Gorbachev himself, who's being kept prisoner by the
coup plotters. It's defeated by one of the nationalist
movements, a Russian nationalist movement led by a politician named Boris
Yeltsin, who wants to break Russia away from the rest of the
Soviet Union. And at the end of 1991, the Soviet Union
is no more. It does break up into its constituent
parts. You can see here, the map of the new Russian Federation with constituent
republics within that vast federation. But then, new independent states, three of
them the Baltic, White Russia, Ukraine, and so
on. Do you remember when we talked about how,
after World War I and the break up of all these empires, there was all this disorder and the definition of new nation
states? Well, that process was happening all over
again, with the breakup of this empire. You can see, for example, the extreme complexity of what was happening in the former Soviet Caucasus,
as different ethnic groups and national
entities organize themselves into new states or
state-lets. So let's now pause for just a moment and
reflect on this extraordinary story. If you read a lot of histories of the Cold
War, it is actually worth asking the question
exactly when did the Cold War end. There's a theory that it ended in 1986.
Gorbachev's in power. It's clear that a confrontation between
the two systems is on the way down. Did it end at the end of 1988, when people like Margaret Thatcher were announcing
that the Cold War is over? Or did it end in the fall of 1990, when Germany was unified and when an arms control agreement began winding down
the military confrontation of the two sides? Or did it only end at the end of 1991,
when the Soviet Union itself broke up? It's not just a parlor game, because by asking that question, in a way, we're
asking: Well, I'll know when the Cold War was over, if you'll tell me what the Cold War was
about. If youï¿½ve followed the argument of this
course, the Cold War was just the last great
chapter in a hundred year long struggle about how
to organize modern industrial societies. We introduced that theme much earlier in
this class. So if you think the Cold War is a chapter in that long, sometimes violent
argument, when did that clash about how to organize these
modern societies really seem to make a decisive turn toward
ending? My argument is that, in Europe, that point is really here, around 1990, because of those crucial
agreements that let people go their own way and begin moving towards variants of
social democracy. But it's interesting to note that in Asia your answer might really be quite
different. It can be that the Cold War starts winding
down by the end of the 1970s. Or it can be that, you know what, maybe the Cold War in Asia only had an armistice and never quite
ended at all. We'll come back to some of those themes as
we take the story forward to today's generation, next week.
See you then.
