[BLANK_AUDIO]. Hi, welcome back. Last time we talked about the bottom billion and some of the problems that
societies beset by chronic violence and turmoil are
dealing with and the way they may be trapped. This time I want to talk about a different kind of outlier from the Great
Convergence. The problems of some Muslim societies in
coming to grips with modernity and adapting to
the modern world, problems that are still
working themselves out. Let's take a closer look. Let's start as a baseline with thinking
about traditional identities in Islamic societies.
As in many traditional societies, you have a ruler, called king or sultan. Clergy.
The clergy in much of the Muslim world is not rigidly
hierarchical or formally organized. In the Sunni parts of the Islamic faith,
the access to the holy word of the Quran is granted to anyone who can acquire literacy
and read the Quran. And there's not a kind of, Pope of Islam. There's more of a structured hierarchy of
clergy in the Shia portion of the Islamic faith. But the clergy in a way are guides. But they also play the role of being
judges because Islam is not only a source of religious belief, it is
also a source of law to govern a wide variety of social and
even commercial interactions, in which the clergy can help to interpret Islamic
law, Islamic jurisprudence. The role of the ruler then is important,
but in a way relatively narrow. More functioning atop the surface of a
deeply traditional society. And in that traditional society identities
are religious, they're also ethno-linguistic, for instance as Arabs, as
Turks, but they're also very, very oriented around families and
clans. So now think about the clash and the overlap between Islamic ideals and
liberal ideals. The whole issue of how or whether Islam
and European style liberalism could be reconciled has been a fertile subject
for comment by many Islamic writers. For instance like Jamal al-Din al-Afghani
during the 1800s, arguing that in fact Islam was quite open
to ideas of tolerance, scientific innovation, that Islam and liberalism were
perfectly compatible. So that Jamal al-Din al-Afghani said that
the clash between Islam and Europe was not over liberalism,
it was over imperialism. It was over foreign intervention in their
societies. On the other hand, some Islamic thinkers have argued that liberal ideals
are simply too tolerant, too open, and instead that Islam needs to push back to defend its culture against the invasion of
outsiders. Therefore, it needs to shelter its commerce, shelter its world of ideas,
shelter its social customs, and can't simply be
passive and open to whatever comes. Another potential tension between Islamic
ideals and liberal ideals is over the notion of a rule of law. In European style liberalism, the rule of
law is the rule of secular law, outside of the set of religious beliefs, tolerant
of different religious beliefs but formed
through civic traditions. In the Islamic tradition, however, the rule of law is deeply
religious, and so the issue of how to accommodate other kinds of legal
preferences is a difficult one. In addition, some liberal ideals are very
much oriented around democracy, majority rule. Islamic ideals aren't necessarily opposed
to majority rule, but there is this tension of suppose the
majority want something that is deemed to be
un-Islamic. Well, for a devout Islamic believer, the
Islamic ideal has to prevail, even if the majority has voted in
a different direction. Because, after all, one is the word of
God. Again, this kind of tension that we talked about in the earlier classes,
between common sense as a liberal ideal, the appeal to
general belief, and the assertion that in fact, general belief might not be an expression of philosophical, religious, or
even scientific truth. But one of the most interesting issues for
Islamic philosophers is: What is the role of the nation state? You see one of the arguments that's being
made in much of the world is that the nation is the definition of the relevant
community, but the nation is an ethno-linguistic
definition of community. It's even a civic definition of community,
and if the nation says, We provide education, we provide laws, and the administration of justice
based on that definition of community, what about people who have a profoundly
religious definition of community? What is the relevance of the nation state in an Islamic ideal of how to organize
governance? So now empathize for a moment with the
dilemma of an Islamic thinker, an Islamic philosopher, confronting
European imperialism in the 1800s, someone like Jamal al-Din
al-Afghani. So his answer back then was to appeal to
pan-Islamic rulers, like say the Caliph of the Ottoman Empire, to represent all of Islam in combating
European imperialism. But especially with the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, what alternatives are
left? Well, one major alternative that's found, is actually a secular and nationalist
answer. So what would be an illustration of that?
Well that would be Mustafa Kemal, also known as Ataturk, and his creation of
the nation state of Turkey.
Another example of that was Reza Shah, and his creation of a more secular
nationalist state called Iran. Both of which were designed to create
another kind of community that could resist outside
imperialism, but did so by emphasizing these definitions of community.
So, here's another answer though. By the 1950s, there was a secular pan-Arab
and socialist answer that was taking shape in places
like Egypt and Syria and Iraq. That's a different definition of
community, indeed Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to create something he
called the United Arab Republic
that would be based in both Egypt and Syria and places like Yemen, united
under rule by Cairo, by of course President Nasser, but representing
a pan-Arab and socialist ideal. As that ideal disappointed, what were
people left with then? They had the secular nationalist answer
with top-down modernizers, national
conservatives in places like Turkey and Iran; pan-Arab socialism
didn't really seem to be very convincing either. There was then a renewal of traditional
answers, that is, maybe an Islamic rule was needed, an Islamic revolution and, of
course, that's exactly what happened in a place like
Iran. Before we turn to the Iranian Revolution
Of the late 1970s, letï¿½s just again get a sense of where Muslims live in the world,
because they live in a lot of diverse places. There are a couple of ways of looking at
this. Take a look, for instance, at this map
that illustrates countries that have more than
a million Muslims. If you studied this map for a minute
you'll immediately realize that the Arab world is certainly not
synonymous with the Muslim world. Indeed, the majority of the worldï¿½s Muslims
are not Arabs, and they live in places as far flung as
Indonesia and even a non-trivial number's in Russia and China and just a
little bit in the United States. Little bits of Muslim population here in
Europe as well, but also in Africa. Here's another map, provided by the Pew
Forum on Religion and Public Life, that's another way of graphically representing the world distribution of
Muslim population. You can see that a country like India
actually has one of the largest Muslim populations in the world,
even though the majority of the population are
Hindus. Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, plus
Indonesia, huge concentration of Muslim population in those four
countries. Then you see Iran here, plus some of the
Arab Muslim world, places like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.
Notice also the significance of Nigeria, here, with
Turkey and the Turkic Muslim world, in this area. The Iranian Revolution of 1978 and 1979 really is an important world historical
development. It represented a rejection of the secular nation state, the national conservative
top-down modernizers. There was an economic agenda there, a
sense of people who were left out, but also an assertion of religious identity.
In Shia Islam, there is a hierarchy of
clerics with ayatollahs being at the top.
This particular rally was taking notice of an exiled ayatollah,
an opponent of the shah's regime, who was returning to Iran
and would lead the Iranian revolutionary government that took power in 1978 and ï¿½79.
Here he is, Ayatollah Khomeini. Ayatollah Khomeini sets himself up as the
absolute authority of Islamic law in Iran, and therefore the
supreme leader of the state. Now among other ayatollahs, the whole
entry of an ayatollah into the more civic domain of taking
charge of a state was something that left them very uneasy, and
is very controversial to this day. But that's been the reigning ideology of the Iranian Revolution for now nearly 40
years. There was another Islamic revolution in
Afghanistan. This one also against a top-down
modernizer, but the revolution in the 1970s in Afghanistan
wasn't against someone who was an ally of the United States, it was
against Top-down modernizers who were allied with
the Soviet Union. Things got so out of hand that the Soviet Union itself felt compelled to invade
Afghanistan with its troops by the end of 1979.
So by the early 1980s, the Muslim world was in a good deal of upheaval.
Saudi Arabia was challenged by this. Because what was happening is the
Iranians are asserting we're now the center of dynamic Islam.
We're now leading the Islamic revolution, and so, just as
Moscow and Beijing were once rivals for who would
lead the international socialist revolution, Tehran and Riyadh had become
rivals as to what would be the center of the Islamic revolutions of the
1980s and 1990s. So Saudia Arabia, with its oil wealth, puts
a huge amount of money behind supporting its version of
Islam, as being dynamic, evangelizing, spreading its faith
throughout North Africa, in Yemen, in countries like Pakistan, through
Islamic foundations, spreading its fundamentalist
view as a way of balancing against the arguments being
made coming out of Iran. But the competition between Saudi Arabia
and Iran, making these fervent Islamic arguments, have some important effects in
places likes Pakistan and Sudan and the Balkans during
the 1990s. Pakistan also then undergoes civil
turmoil, and under a military dictatorship, effectively adopts
a kind of Islamic rule. Sudan consciously adopts an Islamic
government during the 1990s, and gives shelter to the leader of a new
organization called Al-Qaeda, a man named Osama Bin Laden, who lived in Sudan, under the
protection of the Sudanese government, in the early to
mid-1990s. Until, in 1996, he left Sudan for an even better safe haven in Afghanistan,
from which the Soviets had now left, and an Islamic
republic is being created by a group called the
Taliban. And during the 1990s in the Balkans, when
Muslims are under attack in places like Bosnia from Serbians and Christians, both
Catholics or Greek Orthodox Christians, people in Saudi Arabia felt like they
needed to rally to the cause of defending their Muslim brethren
under attack, say, in Bosnia, in Sarajevo. So places like Pakistan, Sudan, the Balkans, all become theaters of
conflict in the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and the general sense among many
Muslims that their faith was under attack. So from the point of view of these
revolutionary Islamic believers in places like Saudi Arabia or in Iran,
in the 1980s and 1990s, who are they against? Well, the Saudi Arabian government isn't
funding people to attack the government of Saudi
Arabia. Now, Al-Qaeda, which is based, at this
point, by the late 1990s, in Afghanistan, is against the
government of Saudi Arabia. But the Saudis and their fundamentalist
beliefs, they're looking at general threat to the Muslim world and indeed the kind of
enemies they identify, like the kind of enemies the Iranians are
identifying, are above all the global America. Not just the American government,
not just American government policies, it's all the things America represents
culturally, socially, that gives them the sense that the Muslim world is not
just under physical attack. It's under cultural attack through the
insidious workings of television, movies, books, the
arguments for the liberation of women that will upend the traditional
social conservatism that they argue is a characteristic of Islam they
want people to practice in Saudi Arabia, in Yemen, in
Pakistan, in Sudan. America isn't their only enemy, they are also opposed to the government of Russia
which they feel is persecuting the Muslims in
Russia's borders, the Chechens in the Caucasus region.
They also hate the government of India, ruled by Hindus persecuting, in their view,
Muslims, and engaged in a geopolitical battle with
the state of Pakistan since the partition of the Indian
subcontinent in 1947. It also had been opposed, of course, to the
state of Israel which had been a chronic irritant ever since its creation
in 1947 and 1948. I haven't talked that much about the Arab-Israeli conflict in the course so
far. I actually find this conflict fascinating. I've spent a lot of time working on it,
but as a historian, I don't think the Arab-Israeli
conflict has actually been a big causal engine in the course of world history,
though I think the Suez Crisis of 1956 itself is
extremely important. But it's worth, in this context, reminding
ourselves what that conflict was about. The creation of a Jewish state of Israel
and the competing claims of national community and identity
in this part of the world. This was the original U.N. scheme of partition. When neither side
really accepted this partition, though the Israeli state was perhaps a little more
willing to go along with it, there was a war in 1948 and 1949 that produced the borders you see here outlined
in red. Then there were a series of further
Arab-Israeli wars in 1967 and 1973. By the end of 1973, all these areas in purple and violet were occupied
by Israel. In a peace treaty with Egypt negotiated
in 1978, this area, the Sinai, was returned to the government of Egypt, the Israelis remain
an occupying power in the West Bank, here, and the Golan Heights, here, overlooking Israeli
agricultural settlements in the Galilee. For some devout Muslims, the whole
existence of the state of Israel is an affront; for many of other devout Muslims, and many
Arabs living in the area, they're prepared to
accept a two-state solution, but they have arguments
about what the delineation of the states should be,
and they want Israel to relax its control of the West Bank and perhaps even the Golan
Heights. So you see all these external enemies that are so much the focus of
Islamic revolutionary hostility in the 1980s and 1990s, but there are also
internal enemies, especially governments like those in Egypt that represent secular
modernizers who don't accept their Islamic ideals,
and, of course, they believe that these governments are puppets of the United
States. At least, that's the view of an
organization like Al-Qaeda. These Islamic revolutions come home over
the last 15 years. A first big explosion actually occurs in
Russia in late 1999. Apartment buildings in Moscow are blown
up. Hundreds of Muscovites lose their lives.
The finger is pointed at Chechen Muslims in the south. This was seized upon by the Yeltsin
government and became the vehicle for the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the
reconstruction of the Russian state. The Russians do find themselves in a civil
war against the Chechen Muslims. Al-Qaeda, an Islamist extremist group
based primarily in Afghanistan, though receiving support
from Pakistan and from the local Taliban, organized a series of attacks against the United States,
attacking embassies in East Africa in 1998,
attacking an American warship in Yemen in October
2000, and finally getting the full attention of
the United States with, of course, the famous 9/11 attacks that
occur on September 11, 2001. The United States thus does acknowledge
that is indeed at war with this group that had
been fighting it for years, and the United States
counterattacks in full force, sending its troops to Afghanistan to chase
Al-Qaeda out of its safe havens, and the remnants retreat
into the state of Pakistan. Here's a map from September 2001. The Taliban mainly controlled this area
you see here. They were locked in a civil war against a Northern Alliance of a number of different
ethno-linguistic groups that are noted on this chart, who are receiving
supports from governments like the Russian government, the Indian
government, the Tajik government. The concentration of American effort then
was to ally themselves with the Northern Alliance, attack southward, defeat the
Taliban allies of Al-Qaeda, run them off, and then chase the Al-Qaeda
remnants away as well. That war has continued in one form or
another up to the present day, and even now in early 2013, there are about 60,000
American soldiers still stationed in Afghanistan, helping the
government of Afghanistan that was reconstructed in 2001 and 2002. The wars in the Islamic world then
expanded to include the state of Iraq. Iraq was a chronic source of conflict for
the last 30 years. It was ruled by one of the most brutal
dictatorships in the entire world under a man named Saddam Hussein,
who took power during the 1970s. In the 1980s, he launches wars against
Iran. Iran counterattacks.
In 1990, he launches another invasion, this one of the neighboring oil sheikdom of Kuwait. An international coalition, under United
Nations authority, rallies, expels him from Kuwait, puts strictures on Iraq, and
what Iraq can do, dismantles the nuclear weapons program, that in 1990-91
was really quite well advanced. Iraq slowly breaks free from those
international restrictions. The international inspections regime that had put in place in 1991 had broken
down by 1997. Chronic tensions ensue over Iraq. Regular low grade combat operations in the
skies over Iraq trying to police the inspection regime keep Iraq from restarting its nuclear or biological
weapons programs. That's the context then,
when America is attacked on 9/11, goes into Afghanistan, and the
American government decides, in 2002, that it has to settle the issue of Iraq once
and for all. Iraq, itself, does not get plunged into
war because it is a center of violent Islamist
extremism. It is not part of an Islamic revolutionary
movement, but a consequence of the American invasion
of Iraq in 2003 and the displacement of the dictator
is they take the lid off a very deeply divided
country. And what happens then, really, is an Iraqi
Revolution. The Shia majority population, in effect,
wants to take over control of the new Iraqi state. That revolution, in turn, triggers a civil war, and the civil war includes the
element of a fight, a war, against the foreign
occupation of the United States. So this is now a fairly complicated war
that ensues. It's both an anti-foreign war, some Iraqis fighting the Americans, but the Americans
are also allied with many Iraqis, including many
Shia, who are trying to establish their new
state. And that new state is in turn prompting a
civil war, in which Sunni Arabs are fighting Shias, Sunnis in the north are fighting
Kurds. In the south, some Shias are fighting other
Shia Arabs, who are also fighting the Americans, so both an international war
and a civil war blending together, until the United States finally withdraws
from Iraq and the country moves into a tenuous peace, still working out
how it will attain long-term peace in a deeply
divided but new state. Now, after the Iraq War subsides, the
attention begins to shift away from the United States, in the foreground of all
these problems in the Muslim world. The United States out of Iraq, United
States withdrawing from Afghanistan, and more and more Muslims, but especially Arabs,
are looking at the governments in charge, and they're rejecting the model of
secular, national dictatorships. There, above
all, we see the revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt,
Libya, where all those dictatorships are being
thrown out. Now, a civil war going on in Syria,
against yet another one of those kind of national dictatorships.
But what will take its place? That's the issue currently being decided in this transitional period in world
history. Ask yourself: What are the options for
what could take the place of these secular, national, or
pan-Arab socialist models? Well, one option, Islamic dictatorships? Tried in Sudan, didn't work out very well.
Being tried in Iran, but the Iranian model is not widely
regarded as a success outside of Iran. Democratic socialism?
This could be another secular model. And that's actually the point of view of a
lot of people in the working class in Egypt,
for instance. They reject the pure Islamist model, but
they want to overthrow the aristocracy created by
the crony capitalism of the top-down modernizers who are
enriching just themselves and their friends at the
expense of everybody else. So, in that sense, the Egyptians might be
looking to models from, say, mid-20th century Mexico or Brazil.
What about Islamic social democracy? The same kind of model we've been talking
about of social democracy, but perhaps with an Islamic flavor: more adherence to
Islamic ideals, figuring out what areas of the public life to carve out for civic
ideals and for Islamic ideals. For instance, just this dilemma and tension
is being worked out in countries like Turkey today, which has reacted against
the purely secular model, with more of an Islamist democracy, but along
these lines of a social democracy. Or in a large country like Indonesia, or
in a country like Bangladesh, or maybe there
is some other option that I'm not putting here, or
some hybrid that we're not seeing. What is clear, then, is that this is a period of active political transition
and turbulence for a lot of the Islamic world, in which they're still sorting out how to organize
their societies. The kind of arguments that played out
through much of the century are very much still playing
out in these countries, including such fundamental issues as: What
will be the role of the half of our population who are
women? So let's pause and take stock of what
we've covered so far. We talked about the postwar settlements,
broad set of political economic structures that
come into play. We've talked about a Great Convergence with globalization and some positive
trends. We've talked about outliers from some of
those positive trends, outliers of two very different kinds, that bottom billion problem, beset by chronic violence, and
also the problems, the distinctive problems, of
some of the Islamic societies and how they're wrestling with how to organize communities and come to grips with
modernism. In the next presentation, I want to return to one more facet of
transition in modern world history. What is going on with modern capitalism? That'll be the subject for next time.
See you then. [BLANK_AUDIO]
