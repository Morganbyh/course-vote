Hi.
Welcome back. Make yourself comfortable. Last time, we talked about the Washington
Consensus that seemed to be ordering the world of the
1990s. Now, I'd like to take stock of how the
world had changed and the new era of world history that seemed to be dawning during the 1990s. In Week Seven, I said that we had ushered
in a kind of hundred year struggle of
contesting ideologies about how to organize these
modern industrial societies. The constant issues in this contest were
issues of identity. Who am I?
What do I stand for? Am I a worker?
Am I a capitalist? Am I an Aryan?
Am I an American? Who am I?
Security, how do I protect myself? What dominant power will look after me?
In what block will I reside? And political economy, how will we
organize my state domestically? Who will take charge of private property
or public property? What are the basic principles for
politics? And in the resolution of these issues, I argue that you increasingly see the
renaissance of classical liberalism. Liberalism the way Europeans originally
were using that term, back in the early to mid-1800s when classical liberalism was at its
zenith. Let's think about some of the ways in which liberal ideals are making a
comeback. First, in the area of identity. As in classical liberalism, a lot about the individual and individual rights and liberties. Remember our discussion of the Rights
Revolution that becomes so important beginning in the
1960s. Rights of women, rights of racial
minorities, ideals that harken back to a lot of that
rhetoric of the late 1700s and the first half of
the 1800s. Security.
Liberals sought security primarily in international cooperation,
relying somewhat less on military power and rival blocs or rival empires
as the source of their security. In political economy, liberals wanted as
little government intrusion economic life as possible in the classical
liberal mode. They celebrated free market principles and
capitalism. [BLANK_AUDIO] Free markets at home.
Free trade between countries. As you can see the terms of the post-Cold War settlement in the early 1990s
actually seemed to be doing quite a lot to be enshrining these
principals and making adherence to these principles more
widespread than ever before. China, for example, signs up to the World
Trade Organization and basic principles of free trade by the
beginning of the 21st century. The spread of democracy is visible in a
map like this one. Before 1939, really just a handful of
democracies left. A couple of states in Europe, Scandinavia,
North America. You can see a lot of these countries now
shaded in green. The spread of democracy across almost all
of South America. The spread of democracy, or at least
partial democracies, through actually much of
sub-Saharan Africa. The introduction, at least, of elections and
partial democracy through much of Eurasia including the old
Soviet Union. Though here, there's a spectrum of
practices. More democracy in Southeast Asia, places
like Indonesia. And even here in the Muslim world, and in
some of East Asia, you can see even in the last
couple of years, beyond the scope of this map,
how democratic revolutions or inspired revolutions have
been shaking up the Muslim world. If you look at in the spread of individual
liberties, one simple test is to look at the extension of the right
of vote to women. This map shows you how this has become more and more a universal
practice. If you look at this category here no
suffrage, here's Saudi Arabia and Oman. The Gulf Emirates. But very few other exceptions now,
anywhere else in the world. By the way, you can also see some parallel
shifts of women moving into employment, where women
are making up more and more of the workforce in these modern
societies. Now, to go back to an earlier lecture, the
one that we had in Week Eight of the course, where I talked about the origins
of modern feminism and modern women, I centered the entry of women into the
workforce, the extension of the right to vote, as starting out especially in the Atlantic world and especially in the
United States of America, to some extent in Britain, also Scandinavia,
in the 1910s and the 1920s. So here we are a hundred years
later, you can see how now modern feminism, and then all the social
and cultural arguments that go with it, are now a commonplace for discussion
in every part of the world. So, now, moving from identity issues to
security issues, we can also see the way those have
changed. Remember in the world in which national empires and great power blocs are
battling against each other, lots of interstate
conflicts, including many interstate conflicts all
through the 1800s. But look at this chart, and it's a crude
chart, it's just the numbers of wars. It doesn't gauge their intensity. But you can generally get the impression
of a small number of interstate conflicts really up until around the middle of the 1980s, at which point they reduce, and,
after the American conflict with Iraq in 2003,
essentially in the last ten years reducing to
virtually zero. What's taking its place are a lot of internal conflicts that rise since the
1970s and remain a significant theme. But internal conflicts are very different
from the kind of international blocs that had characterized a lot of the world
order ever since the 1600s. So, the way in which people get security
is more focused on how they get security at home against social dangers arising
within their societies, not so much the obsession with the military balance between rival blocs of
states. If you turn to the economic principles,
the rise of these economic liberal principles, international
financiers, globalization are a big topic all through the 1990s. The notion of a Washington Consensus
around these principals, and maybe even a little
bit of the hubris surrounding that moment at
the end of the 1990s, is captured here. Depicted in the picture, towards the end of the administration of
Bill Clinton, is the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Allen
Greenspan, in the center, and two former Secretaries of the Treasury
from that era: Robert Rubin over here on the left side of the picture, and Larry
Summers, on the right side of the picture. It is interesting to notice why they are
on the cover of this magazine. They're on the cover of this magazine
because, for about the preceding two years, there had been a constant run of
financial crises involving Russia, Brazil, Southeast Asia,
Korea, because one thing that goes with this new,
freer international financial system is more volatility of the kind that was also
evident in the early gold standard era. That volatility is being managed by American officials,
central bankers, but of course, to us now, we know that nine
years after this picture is taken the world will be plunged into a
financial crisis of extraordinary proportions that brings us
to the precipice of another Great Depression. So by the early 1990s, that hundred year
struggle is ending in a kind of great convergence, an ideological convergence that we can
trace using some of our old charts. Remember this menu of political families
in which the most important ones were the
Democratic Socialists, that the state should own all property, Liberals, National Conservatives -- but the
National Tradition Party, Revolutionary Socialist Party. Then by the 1920s that had morphed.
These families, the Revolutionary Socialists turn into
Communists and Fascists and, by the 1920s, all of these political families are
of roughly comparable influence. That then turned into the world of the
1930s, in which the Communists and the Fascists
were probably the most influential political movements, with the new hybrid
Social Democracy coming in third. Then we saw that in the postwar era the two dominant factions are the Communists
and the Social Democrats. Democratic Socialists remain important,
as do National Conservatives, top-down modernizers often in authoritarian or semi-authoritarian
states, with some residuum of liberalism, but now
much smaller in influence, and fascism almost disappearing from view. But now look how this morphs into the
present day. Social Democracy massively important,
remaining massively important. Indeed most of the political parties in what we think of as the United
States, Europe, are different shadings along a spectrum of Social Democratic
parties, in my definition of this term. But the other hugely important faction are
National Conservative ideologies. For instance, I classify the leadership of
China today as National Conservatives. I classify the leadership of Russia today as National Conservatives. I frankly can classify the leadership of a
place like Iran also as National Conservatives, though I'll note
in a moment of a particularly idiosyncratic
kind. Liberalism probably is third most
important as a continuing influence and an undercurrent underneath Social
Democracy, with Democratic Socialism still there but
running kind of a fourth, and communism and fascism on the extremes,
almost at the vanishing point. This is a little bit what I mean by a
sense of ideological convergence. But, I want to admit to some problems of
classification with my fancy typologies. For example, National Conservative
oligarchies. Take, for instance, the problem of China.
China is ruled by a communist party. The Communist Party not only controls the
ministries of the state, the Communist Party effectively select the leaders of
all of China's leading companies, also party
members. Including many other non-profit and
academic organizations. So what are we to make of a National
Conservative oligarchy of this kind? Is it turning into some other variant of a total state?
Anyway, challenging. Or an Islamic republic, like, for example, the Islamic Republic of
Iran or the new Islamic republic that for the moment has taken hold in Egypt after the Muslim Brotherhood has
been elected. We could classify it as National Conservative but somehow that category
doesn't fit as neatly there. The Iranian leadership, for example, does
have transnational revolutionary goals for the spread of Islamic ideals -- a
hard problem. Maybe this is some new type, limited at
the moment only a few countries, but it might become more
important in the Muslim world. Too soon to tell. And there's a third category which we can just call: enabled
predators. They may carry the title of president and
say they're in charge of a democratic republic, but if you look at
the rule of someone like Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, it's hard not to just simply
see them as these are dictators who are simply looting the instruments of
their state and looting their countries, to dignify this with an ideological title like National Conservative does them too
much justice. But as we step back, it is remarkable to notice, in the early 1990s, the degree of
convergence that's going on, the beckoning, perhaps, of a new dawn in
which the era of great power conflict and the rivalry
of great power blocs and large rival empires has finally come to an
end, at least come to an end in a form in which we knew it
before. That doesn't mean that a new utopia is taking
over the world. It does mean, though, that we have
entered, in this period, the last 20 years, a really new phase of
world history with different kinds of issues than the issues
that have dominated so much of the world's political and economic life
over the previous hundred years. It's that new world I want to spend some more time on, when I
see you again next time. See you then.
