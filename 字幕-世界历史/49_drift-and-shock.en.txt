Hi welcome back. This presentation is going to focus on
what happened to global capitalism over the
last ten years. In an earlier presentation, we talked about
the unheralded creation of a new global financial system in the late
1970s and early 1980s. I talked about an impossibility theorem
where you have a trilemma, and you have to make
certain choices. And I said that, in effect, political
leaders prioritize the free movement of convertible money at the
expense of national economic independence. That's a little more like the gold
standard system of the late 1800s and early 1900s. The gold standard system had a lot of
advantages: money moved back and forth, financing was
really easy for companies that wanted to conduct business overseas.
But, downsides. Because money can swing back and forth
from one place to another, the danger of volatility, of financial crises,
goes up. And that's exactly been the pattern in the
1990s and in the last decades: more frequent
financial crises, the most severe of them being the crisis experienced in 2008.
I want to call this explanation of it more money
than sense, in a way I mean that quite
literally. Let's look at global imbalances that
emerged in the behavior of the world economic system in
the 2000s. Alright.
Here's a complicated chart. I get this chart from the International
Monetary Fund. You don't have to understand all these
initials up here. The only thing I want you to really focus on in this
chart are these graphs. Here. And here. These measure global imbalances as a
percent of world GDP. What do we mean about a global imbalance? If a lot of people are running current
account deficits, that is, they're buying more stuff than
they're selling back, then they're in a deficit. I'm paying out more money than I'm
bringing in. You can get a current account deficit from
a lot of things. If I'm buying more than I'm bringing in,
or if I'm borrowing more than I'm loaning out in return, I can get
a current account deficit. Some current account deficits, you know,
surpluses and deficits between trading countries,
totally natural. What was alarming is the huge increase in
the scale of these imbalances. And it's then really especially the huge
surpluses. This is a percentage of the world's gross
domestic product. So let's figure that this period here, you see less
than 1% of world GDP. So, this is something in the
neighborhood of a $100 billion-$150 billion, something
like that. And that's pretty much a fair
historical range for what the global imbalances had
looked like. By this peak point around 2005-2006, global imbalances had
sharply gone up from, oh, in the neighborhood of
$150 billion to this point, where you're more than two
and a half percent, pushing three, now we're at, like, $400 billion
surpluses. That's a lot of money, even in a giant
world economy. $400 or $500 billion in surpluses, and you can
see that the United States deficits are
contributing quite a lot to that. That means that the surplus countries are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars, and they need to do something with those hundreds of billions of dollars. Theyï¿½re sitting in their bank accounts ï¿½ I have hundreds of billions of dollars, what do I do with it? Well, Iï¿½m obviously not buying American goods with that, or else I wouldnï¿½t have this surplus and deficit. So they can say well let me buy things
that are priced in dollars. Let me buy assets, land, deeds, mortgages, bonds, that are priced in dollars with my
hundreds of billions of dollars. So there's therefore a demand for dollar
valued assets. And the same would be true for Euro-valued assets between surplus and
deficit countries in the Euro Zone and so on, but I'm using the dollar case because
it's the easiest one to understand. Therefore, you would expect, with this
huge amount of global imbalances, that there would be a lot of pressure, a
lot of demand for dollar assets. Where there's a lot of demand for anything, then you have a supply-demand
relationship. Just think about that. All of you know from your basic economics
that if a lot of dollars are chasing after few goods,
the price of the good is going to go up. Supply, demand. A lot of demand, limited supply, price
goes up. Now suppose there's a lot of demand, not for consumer goods
but for assets. The price of the assets is going to go up.
So here are hundreds of billions of dollars looking for American assets.
Let's say, housing, real estate. So you would expect to see, because of these global imbalances, a significant
amount of asset inflation. That is all those hundreds of billions of
dollars chasing after dollar valued assets and the price
of those assets going up, like the price of U.S. real estate. Another interesting phenomenon that occurs
is, hey, people want assets. Can we create assets that we can sell to
them? And you say: Well, I get a mortgage on a house. If I bundle together a bunch of different
mortgages, I can resell them as a new kind of mortgage
instrument, I have something else I can sell on international
markets, and then maybe I can even sell bets on the behavior of
those mortgage assets and bets on top of the bets.
And so, asset inflation, asset invention, and the asset invention looks like a good
deal because the price of the underlying assets just keeps
going up and up. Now if this goes out of control, two sorts
of governmental systems have broken down. Kind of stop for a moment, ask yourself:
Who controls inflation? Ordinarily, the kind of inflation people
control is inflation in consumer prices. Consumer price inflation: CPIs. So, like, the price of milk, the price of
cars. The way consumer price inflation is
controlled is central banks do things, raising interest rates, other things to
try to dampen demand, if they think inflation is getting
out of control. Well here's huge demand, but it's not for
consumer goods. It's not showing up in consumer price
inflation. It's showing up in asset inflation. So, central banks, they see the asset
inflation going on, but they do nothing about it
because, after all, they're not ordinarily accustomed to
wanting to control asset inflation. Indeed, they think asset inflation might even be a
positive thing. Assets are being invented all over the place, all these peculiar financial
instruments that are being invented to satisfy the hunger of
all these different funds who want to buy
them, especially these mortgage instruments.
Who's supposed to police asset invention? Well, that would be things like bank
regulators or the Securities and Exchange Commission,
various other kinds of entities that are supposed to regulate
the financial industry. Well, here, there is domestic
breakdowns in the United States regulatory system and
in others. But because so much of the literature
about this crisis is focused on the breakdown of
domestic regulators, it's useful though to keep in mind that
behind the breakdown of domestic regulation, the underlying
cause goes back to this. This then creates the pressures that these
policemen needed to manage, and then these policemen
failed to manage the resulting asset inflation
and asset invention that then produces this spectacular financial
crisis. The result then being the bust. The bust is already beginning to happen in
2007. Some of the regulators and some of the government institutions are beginning
to notice this. But actually, largely, they don't notice it
in 2007, even though a lot of the people involved
in the industry at the time, I knew some of these people, they had the sense that they were riding
something they did not understand and they couldn't quite figure out where this
was going to end up, but, at the moment, they were making
money from it, and they didn't really even know what
to do about it and weren't 100% sure it was a
problem. So, no one intervenes to try to slake this
demand, to reign this in, until it's too late in
2008. And then, of course, large financial
institutions begin to collapse entirely. Other financial institutions are going to break down. The whole banking system begins to break
down. Now, banking system, financial systems are
kind of unglamorous. But, in a way, for an economy they have
the same function as your heart and your circulatory system does.
This is, in effect, a heart attack of the global economy, and, of course, all the
muscles, brain, they need blood pumping through the circulatory system. It doesn't take much of a heart attack to
get everybody's attention. As you can see here, this cartoonist reflecting on what the bust meant for his
generation of Americans. So, here of course some drier data, not a Cartoon, that shows you how the bust is
playing out: very sharp declines, not just in the advanced economies but also in emerging
market economies, in both industrial production and in world
trade. Some recovery shortly after that, but then you can see, actually, here it's
sputtering pretty close to the line of zero growth
worldwide. Another interesting thing to notice about this chart from the International Monetary
Fund. is notice unemployment, unemployment rates: contrast 2007 and 2013,
so six years, that's the unemployment rate for
the United States over those six years. That's the unemployment rate for the Euro
Zone area over those six years. Middle East and North Africa a little
worse, not much worse. Actually Latin American countries a tiny
bit better. But that's a key point for the world
economy. Now the analogy everybody looks when they
study this recent financial crisis of 2008 is they think back to the
Great Depression of the late 1920s, early 1930s. The causes of the Great Recession, though, are pretty different from the causes of
the Depression of the late '20s and early
'30s, which I went over in another video
presentation. There are some things in common, but
really quite a lot is different. But also different is that, so far, the Great Recession has not tumbled into a
Great Depression. Remember, back in the Great Depression, it
wasn't just one event. There was an initial series of events at
the end of the 1920s. Then folks were beginning to recover but then there was another series of events,
actually emanating out of Europe in the 1930s,
especially 1931, and that pushed folks over the
precipice. In effect, we've had that first stage. We've had that terrific initial shock, and
the great issue is: Are we going to have another phase of economic crisis that will
push folks over the edge? So far, that second phase of acute crisis
has been avoided. Why? How have we been able to manage the
crisis? Well first, we've been able to preserve the
international financial system. How did that happen? Looking back at the Great Depression
period, a key problem was actually a political
problem: the inability to cooperate among the
key holders of the world's reserve currencies, in figuring out how to
coordinate their monetary policies and support each other. It very quickly became a situation of
everyone for himself. And here tensions between France and
Germany were already a factor in Europe. And then there were tensions across the
Atlantic. The breakdown of the World Economic
Conference in 1933 as the United States said, "We're going to
take care of ourselves." That has not happened this time. The central banks have been pitching in to help each other and sustain each other's
reserve currencies. When folks were having trouble taking
euros or having trouble taking dollars, central banks on the other side of the
Atlantic intervening to help. Those are fundamentally political
decisions. It looks like an economic judgment, but underneath it is a level of political
harmony that allows this to happen.
That's important. A second aspect of crisis management is
nationalizing debts. What do I mean by that? Let me give you a concrete example. Let's take a federal mortgage insurance
entity, Fannie Mae. That's Fannie Mae is short for something called the Federal National
Mortgage Association. Fannie Mae was a mortgage insurance
operator, and they issued mortgages. They underwrote mortgages to lots and lots
of homeowners, and then, Fannie Mae sold those mortgages as bundled
instruments to investors, who wanted to buy mortgages and get some of
the interest being paid by all of the people who were getting
home loans. So, Fannie Mae would help be sure that people got home loans. They'd bundle all these home loans, and then re-sell them to, say, the Chinese
government. The Chinese government would use some of
its many billions of dollars in its reserves, remember that
global imbalances point. The Chinese government bought tens of
billions dollars of mortgage instruments issued by
Fannie Mae. Alright.
So Fannie Mae's debts are falling apart. A lot of those mortgages are just not
going to be paid. So what's going to happen here? One option is, Fannie Mae just goes belly
up. Anybody who's holding a Fannie Mae
instrument, well, they're just stuck holding the bag. In that case, the Chinese government, the
bond holder, would be left holding the bag, and the Chinese
government might lose billions of dollars that they'd invested in the United States, maybe even tens of billions of dollars. But that doesn't happen. Instead, the United States government
nationalized those debts. The United States government essentially
took over Fannie Mae and said, if any of those things go belly up,
that's on the U.S. taxpayer. That's going to be on the federal
governmentï¿½s accounts. Now that's real good news for the bond
holders, say, like the Chinese government which
invested all this money in US mortgage bonds and is now being protected from losing a lot of that
money because the United States government has
nationalized its debts, and does that with other banks. By the way, similar things are happening in actions of European governments bailing out their banks. Now what does that mean? It means that the United States government, and those European government, have now assumed some pretty heavy losses. That's very costly for those governments.
If you add on those nationalized debts, on top of money you're spending as,
say, stimulus to help get your economy back on
its feet, to provide unemployment compensation,
things like that, governments start running budget deficits.
They're short on money. So nationalizing debts is a crisis
management tool. Helps reassure foreign
investors. But there's a price, itï¿½s that it puts a significant pressure on your own national budget accounts, it
takes those private problems and makes them now public debt problems.
And of course, that's why in the United States, for example, we have constant
running controversies now about American deficits and tax increases.
Another form of crisis management is to do things to encourage
people to spend money, to borrow money, keep the
economy going. The government can simply print money and
spend it. Also, the central banks can reduce
interest rates and encourage people to borrow money and
reduce interest rates almost to the point of being virtually
zero. The United States government, European
governments, the Japanese government, they've all done this, pretty much to about the limit they think
they can prudently go. They've all found that that gets you something, but it doesn't get you very
far. It's a little like providing a patient in
the hospital with an adrenaline shot or someone who's feeling their energy
flagging and eats a lot of sugar. You can get that sugar high,
that'll get you going for a while, but it'll only take
you so far. It doesn't necessarily strengthen any of the underlying muscle tissue of the
economy. It doesn't necessarily rebuild the quality
of your financial system, the quality of that heart and circulatory system that
you need to be pumping a lot of blood. For that you might need deeper structural
reforms. But these are all things that one can do as crisis management, and so far
crisis management has succeeded. Now, since the United States, Europe, and so on, they've had this tremendous
economic shock, does that mean that the model of global
capitalism has now come to an end? That, that whole system created specially
in the late 70s and early 1980s has now shown that it's no
longer valid, and we're going to turn across the world
to different economic models? Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know
the answer. I can see, though, that there already some
immediate effects. For example, the United States found itself, during these wars of
the 2000s, with an unwanted empire. It was occupying the country of Iraq.
It was setting up a protectorate in the country of
Afghanistan. I'll tell you, whatever people may think
around the world, the vast, vast majority of the American
people do not want to rule the country of Iraq, and they do
not want to rule or be responsible for the
country of Afghanistan. They want to get out of those responsibilities as quickly as they
possibly can. In the case of Iraq, they've done so and they're on their way to doing so in
the case of Afghanistan, and certainly having financial and fiscal
crises only adds more momentum to devolving itself of an
unwanted empire. What about the challenge to global
capitalism? Does this crisis mean that the 1980s globalized model is dead and that some other model will take its
place? Maybe a model where the example is being
set by China? Does it mean that we need to have a more
national financial system? That the whole trilemma bargain we set in
the early 1980s needs to be reconsidered? Instead of free-flowing money, we now, to
have national economic systems again that radically reduced the flow of global
capital So far, that hasn't been the answer. Will this create a challenge to social
democracy? Think a little bit about the structure of modern
governance. 50, 60 years ago, in the 1950s, look at where government spent most of their
money: In the United States, other advanced
countries, most of the public money was spent on
defense. Some significant amount of money was being
spent on social welfare: 20, 30, 40%. But 60-70% of the national
government budget went to defense. All those proportions are now hugely
reversed today. Now, in the United States, and all the
other advanced countries, including Japan, the large majority, 70-
80% plus, of their national government accounts is
being spent on social welfare. Now those expenditures are under much more
pressure. A lot of these debts have been
nationalized. Populations have been aging. Will the social democratic model of big government helping to somewhat
redistribute money, provide social welfare, help manage some
of the tensions of global capitalism, is that model still viable? Well, if your answer to either of these
questions is maybe not, think about what are the alternatives,
because one of the points we've been making all through this course is to
think of situations, problems, solutions. So there are choices, it's not just abstractly saying: Well that doesn't
work. That's bad. People won't change unless they think
they've got something better to take its place
Well, what are the alternatives then?
Alternatives could be things like: Are we seeing a widespread renewal of interest in
democratic socialism? Are we seeing a widespread effort to create national capitalism to take the place of global capitalism. By the way, the Chinese model of state
capitalism with lots and lots of powerful state owned
enterprises is a pretty interesting hybrid model of
national capitalism at home with a tolerated degree of participation in
global capitalism as a whole. But is the Chinese model itself viable for
the long haul? Is the Chinese model really a possible
replacement for the models of America and Europe? Or is there some other model that I just donï¿½t have the wit to think of? Those are some of the issues created by the current crisis. Itï¿½s not the only kind of challenge weï¿½re going to have to think about as we look at this transitional period of world history. Weï¿½ll tackle some others in the next presentation. See you then.
