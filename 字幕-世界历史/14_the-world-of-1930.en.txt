Hi.
Welcome back. Make yourself comfortable. Let's take a look around the world of
1930. A big point I want to make is that we look
back on this period, let's say 1930, and a common term
historians use for it is to call it the: Inter-War Period. See, we're so conscious that Word War II
is coming, and that World War I had just ended, that this
looks almost like a brief interval. Some historians even write of it almost
like a truce period, an armistice, between the
two wars. And actually, it's very common for people
to think: Yeah, because of the way the first war ended, it was so unsatisfactory,
we were bound to have the second war. So, this is just a pause, an interval, in
the general descent. My point here is this is not such a linear
story. That actually the world of 1930 hadn't
solved its problems, but it was actually slowly rebuilding,
reconstructing, holding the center together, though it was
fragile. Let's take a look at what's going on among
the Great Powers. Among the Great Powers, the Americans are
very involved commercially, financially, and
politically in East Asia. But the Great Powers were still thought of
as being mainly centered in Europe; the Americans sometimes playing a role.
And in Europe in the late 1920s, there's a
feeling of cautious optimism because the British,
French and Germans have reconciled some of their differences,
during the middle of the 1920s, through meeting of the minds:
a pact at the city of Locarno, in which the three leaders agree to respect the
postwar status quo, at least in the West; the Germans are still pretty uneasy about
their borders with Poland. A key figure in the spirit of Locarno
was the leader of the German Republic, this man: Gustav Stresemann. Stresemann is what we would now think of as a conservative figure, but very much a centrist figure, very
nationalist. But he wants to hold the republic together by making some concessions to
German nationalism, anger, resentment but also finding a
stable working relationship with the British and
the French. Some people argue that Stresemannï¿½s
premature death is one of the tragedies of German politics in
this era. In addition to a fragile but meaningful understanding among the Great Powers in
Europe, there's also an international institution,
the League of Nations, meant to help regulate
disputes. It's up and running at its headquarters in
Geneva, Switzerland. One of its principal buildings is this
one, named for Woodrow Wilson, a founding spirit of the League,
this is the Palais Wilson, though the United States itself is not a member of
the League. The League of Nations is up and running, getting involved in some disputes, creating some international
organizations, building up an ideal that there might be
a way of managing disputes through
institutions of international cooperation: courts to arbitrate dispute, treaties to
regulate the use of weapons in war had become increasingly
important since the early 1900s. And in the late 1920s, those ideas looked
to a lot of people like the wave of the future, getting a lot of attention
in universities around the world. There's an active agenda of disarmament. There had been an important treaty to
regulate the size of navies that was signed in Washington at
the beginning of 1922. That treaty was seen as working out reasonably successfully; the agenda
was moving to how to regulate armies, which, by the way, turns out to be a much,
much harder problem. But anyway, there was an active agenda for disarmament being pursued by the Great
Powers. In the economic/financial side,
the gold standard is coming back. That was the standard money that had
knitted much of the world together before World
War I. After the war, it's being revived, with a
lot of help from the United States, though less from the United States
government and more from various United States private firms working in
cooperation with the US government, helping
effectively to provide loans to countries that didn't
have enough gold, didn't have enough hard
currency, and using American credit to help rebuild an
international financial system built on the gold
standard. One of the principal initiatives in the
late 1920s was named for its American author:
the Young Plan. Meanwhile, the Europeans still are
maintaining their empires which are increasingly on the
defensive and embattled, as they try to give somewhat more autonomy to the local peoples but
find that actually local peoples disagree over
what their states should be like and that the imperial powers becoming an
umpire between warring local parties, in some cases, a very reluctant umpire. One reason for these battles is because
all kinds of new nation states are being built and all kinds of new
nation states are being envisioned. Just to offer you a contrast between the world before World War I, see Russian Empire, German Empire, Austro-Hungarin Empire, Ottoman Empire;
then look at the reorganization of Eastern
Europe, of the Ottoman Empire into all these
different states, each of them trying to decide what their
states should be like. What should it be modeled
on? For instance, the Arabs are being given states; they had been on the fringes of the
Ottoman Empire. One of the leading Arab princely families is
represented here: that's Prince Faisal in the foreground,
behind him are some of his British and French advisors, perhaps best known is this man right here: T.E. Lawrence, sometimes known as Lawrence of Arabia. And Prince Faisal's family becomes the
ruling family of this new country, here in Iraq, and this new
country, here in Trans-Jordan, both made up of remnants from the Ottoman
Empire. This area here, Palestine, is divided
between both Arab and Jewish populations. During World War I, the British had made
contrasting promises to both Arabs and Jews about who could
live in Palestine, and the British find themselves being the
umpire in the growing disputes between those national communities. The French were finding themselves being
an umpire in ethnically divided Syria, and so
on. You'll note here over at the side, Persia,
which through much of the 1800s was ruled by the decaying warrior dynasty Qajars, is
also remaking itself, at the beginning of the
1900s, into a nation state with a constitution,
and in the 1920s, a new constitutional
monarchy whose ruler is the Shah. Of course, not everybody is included
happily in these settlements. The Soviet Union is kind of cast out on
the outside, kept at arm's length, because, after all, it's
dedicated to overthrowing all the others. But the Soviet example, and the example of
communism, is appealing for some. For instance these young Indonesians, they're looking for their
inspiration, see the Soviet Union as a model, and form a Communist Party of
Indonesia. They take the Dutch East Indies, a unit
created by colonialism, and want to turn that into a nation state
called Indonesia, which could be organized on the principles
of communism, opposing Dutch imperialism. There is a rich menu of examples and
quarreling ideologies for people to choose from at the
end of the 1920s and in 1930. Still a lot of division. One of the more attractive models you
would look at, if you were a new nation state, would be Turkey, which has remade itself
into a vigorous nation state under its
strongman ruler Ataturk. Here Ataturk is showing his devotion to
education. Ataturk, by the way Mustafa Kemal, very
interested in the theories of the American liberal
educator John Dewey. He's adopting a whole new alphabet for Turkey that he thinks is more
progressive. He's aggressively secular, trying to wipe
all Muslim habits out of Turkish public life. There's also the example, attractive to
many, of fascist rule in Italy, where Mussolini, it is commonly said,
now can get the trains to run on time. In Barcelona, Spain is now ruled by the
military dictator Primo de Rivera, a National
Conservative, a top-down modernizer. To show off Spain's new strength, its
desire to welcome the world, he actually hosts, in Barcelona, an
International Exhibition in 1929. The International Exhibition shows off
some of the diversity of choices in architecture.
You see here, the emphasis on neoclassical architecture, remolding older
designs for the modern era. Or for instance in this illustration. Including, you see, these modern clock
towers, illuminated at night with
beautiful electric lights. Another contrasting example of modernity was provided by the German exhibition,
showing off the works, in this case, of the architect Mies van der
Rohe. Spare, functionalist. In fact, this German exhibition was torn
Down a year later. Devotees of modern architecture have made
sure that it was rebuilt in Barcelona in the 1980s. Of course, there is still a lot of dissent
seething beneath the surface. For example, the German painter, George Grosz, has this
bitter portrait of the pillars of society. You see in the background: the army, with the sword covered with
blood; the church, represented here not very
attractively; the businessmen crowding up to the bar. You might hope that all these warring political factions will somehow
hold together in liberal harmony. That's actually the dream of this German
cartoonist, who at the very end of the 1920s you see:
here's Germany, that's the German eagle, asleep, dreaming of a sunlit, radiant dawn
with a rainbow in which the communists, the
liberals, the Catholic center, the national conservative
businessman, the conservative Bavarian farmer, and the Nazis over here, all link
hands in harmony. His dream of a happier Germany. In Shanghai, a new Republic of China is
getting up on its feet. It's leader is a man in uniform. Chang
Kai-Shek is a symbol of that National Conservative
ideology. Top-down, modernizer, nationalizer, but also at times veering a little bit
towards fascist authoritarianism, too. And if we flip back to the United States
of America, go to a city like Chicago in 1928, 1929,
1930, we'd see an example of something called
corporatism: businesses trying to heal the divide between business and labor by businessmen engaging in welfare
capitalism, giving their workers better wages,
providing more services to their workers. The kinder, gentler face of
big business. Business trying to use the economic growth
of the 1920s to take better care of laborers, to head off further disputes. And in the city, local government juggling
the claims of different ethnic groups. A liberal model, holding together. But this world of 1930 I'm describing, it's a broken world that's being
reconstructed, but the cement isn't really dry.
The structure is still really fragile, and it's about to get buffeted by a
terrific storm. And that's going to be our subject for
next week, both the storm and what came of it. See you then.
