Hi, welcome back.
Make yourself comfortable. In this presentation, we're going to to
see how the world came to the edge of global nuclear
war. The context is a period of time between
about 1958 and 1962 that historians think of as the years of
maximum crisis during the Cold War. A curtain raiser for that is in 1957, when
the Soviets begin demonstrating their capability to
launch heavy missiles and put things into space. The first thing they put into space in 1957 is an earth orbiting satellite called
Sputnik. That the Soviets could do this, was of
course, the cause of great excitement in the United States, as you
can see from this banner headline. Or you can see in this cartoon by Edwin
Marcus, the beep beep from the Russian satellite is definitely
shaking Uncle Sam out of his complacency. In 1958, there are a series of crises. In Iraq, for example, the monarchy that
had long been supported by the British and by the Americans was
violently overthrown, the ruler murdered. What takes its place is a nationalist
dictatorship. The Americans are worried that this will
create an opportunity for Soviet meddling in the
Middle East. They even land troops in Lebanon in 1958. No opposition there, but just to kind of show American support for some of the existing
governments, as America is trying to balance how to stay on the right side of Arab nationalism
while also supporting its other friends and
building up a new anti-communist bulwark against
Soviet penetration there. And then there's a new crisis as communist China and the exiled
government of the Republic of China are in a military stand-off over some islands
in the Taiwan Straits. The United States, defending the Republic
of China with its treaty of alliance and its warships, finds itself in a low-grade military confrontation to deter a
communist Chinese attack. The communist Chinese, meanwhile, are
secretly pleading for the Soviet Union to give them nuclear weapons so they'll be in a
better position in this confrontation. The Soviet refusal to give them those
nuclear weapons intensifies the split between Mao
and Khrushchev. And then there's a crisis over Berlin.
Berlin, remember, is that great city of Germany, sitting divided in the middle of
a new communist East German state. Here's an image of divided Berlin. Remember, surrounding Berlin is a
Communist state, East Germany, supported by the Soviet Union, ringed by Soviet and
East German forces. These Western military zones of occupation are again
feeling beleaguered, as Khrushchev and the East Germans say
we're going to liquidate the postwar status of West Berlin and make all of
Berlin part of East Germany. Because right now, West Berlin is a kind
of hole in the East German state through which more and more Germans
are leaking away, fleeing to the West. Khrushchev wants to convert this embarrassment to East Germany into a
triumph for Soviet power. By forcing the West out of Berlin, he'll
have forced the West to symbolically climb down from this exposed position, showing
his power and influence. In effect, the new Communist leaders of
the late 1950s have come out of their crisis period in the mid
1950s, after Stalin's Death, with some grand designs. In Mao's China, he's has a new revolutionary goal of a Great Leap
Forward, I talked about that in the last video
Presentation, convulsing his country in an effort to
rapidly industrialize it, with more tense relations with all of his
neighbors, including India. Meanwhile, Mao's revolutionary ambitions
are colliding with Khrushchev's goals. Khrushchev doesn't want Mao to get in a
war with the United States. He doesn't trust Mao enough to give them
Soviet nuclear weapons that would just be turned over to the Chinese,
giving the Chinese the technology. And Khrushchev wants himself and the
Soviet Union to remain the leader of the international
communist movement. The result of these tensions is a Sino-Soviet split, largely in secret, but which breaks open
by 1960. That creates a kind of dangerous triangle,
United States and its allies, Soviet Union, China,
because the Soviets and the Chinese are now competing with each
other to show who is the true inheritor of the great
Communist legacy. Who should lead the communist movement? And as Khrushchev travels around the
communist world, visits the United States, he's increasingly
developing his own grand design. If you want to understand Khrushchev's
grand strategy in these crisis years, his grand design, let's break it
down into four pieces. In other words, this is the solution to
his problem. His problem: How do I demonstrate
leadership with the communist world? How do I reinvigorate my country? How does he solve these problems?
One, increase his nuclear missile power, or at
least the appearance of his nuclear missile power, to make the
Soviet Union look strong. Use this to win a huge symbolic victory over the exposed Western position
in Berlin. Meanwhile, cut spending on the huge Soviet
military, the conventional Forces, which make up make up most of the
spending in his military budget. And, with that money released, devote more attention to developing the
Soviet economy, providing more consumer goods,
and actually maybe even allowing a bit of a thaw in
Soviet domestic and literary life. So, it kind of creates a bit of a
paradoxical image. Here's Khrushchev brandishing his
missiles, trying to have a showdown over Berlin. But partly, so that he can release funds in other parts of his military
establishment and actually reinvigorate and renew the Soviet
experiment. Khrushchev and Eisenhower are headed
toward a summit in Paris in the spring of 1960, where they're going to have it
out over a number of issues, principally Berlin, when the
Soviets shoot down an American reconnaissance
flight, secretly taking photographs to try to understand
just how many missiles the Soviets do have. The Soviets keep the shoot down a secret. The Americans don't acknowledge that it's
happened. Then Khrushchev triumphantly unveils that
he actually has captured alive the CIA contract pilot who'd been
flying the aircraft, now a Soviet prisoner, Francis Gary
Powers, later returned in a spy exchange. And here you see him inspecting the
wreckage of the downed American aircraft. The summit with Eisenhower is canceled,
Khrushchev waits for the next American president to bring his plans
to fruition. Meanwhile, one of the background factors
in 1961 is yet another crisis over the new
revolutionary regime in Cuba. Fidel Castro's Cuba more and more tightly
aligned with the Soviet Union. The Americans, hostile now to this new Communist bastion
right off their shores, sponsor, secretly, an attempted invasion of
Cuba by a group of Cuban exiles, because, of course, a lot of
Cubans were deeply disillusioned by the way Castro, they
thought, had hijacked their revolution. The Cuban exiles invade Cuba. They're defeated by Cuban forces. The Americans who had been backing them do
not come to their aid. They allow the exiles to be rounded up,
slaughtered, and captured. But it's a huge embarrassment to the
Kennedy Administration which has to acknowledge its sponsorship of this
misbegotten venture in April of 1961. Castro comes out of this believing that the Americans are going to be after him
somehow. And Khrushchev comes out of it thinking
that his alliance with Cubans helped deter the Americans from doing anything to
invade Cuba with their forces. Kennedy, for his part, wants little to do
with Cuba as possible. He thinks Cuba as an annoyance, a distraction from the great superpower
issues. But members of his administration
continued to be obsessed with it, coming up with scheme
after scheme to try to use the intelligence
services to get rid of Castro in some way. Khrushchev and Kennedy then have their summit
meeting. It takes place in Vienna, June 1961. The summit meeting is a complete failure. Khrushchev browbeats Kennedy, Kennedy
comes away convinced that the superpowers are heading toward an even greater
confrontation centered on Berlin. In the fall of 1961, Khrushchev and the
East Germans actually build a physical wall cutting off West Berlin from
East Berlin, shooting down anyone who attempts to climb over the wall to escape
to freedom in West Berlin. A grim symbol of the Cold War, that Berlin Wall, but that doesn't end the
Berlin Crisis. It's cauterized the communistic wound, but
it hasn't eliminated it. And indeed Khrushchev is going forward in
1962 determined to get his triumph on Berlin. Alright as if this were not enough, here's
one more compelling factor. The American's are realizing that the
Soviet brandishing of their missile power is kind of a bluff. The Soviets don't have as many long range
missiles as the Americans feared they might. Khrushchev, trying to show off his power
in other ways, ends a moratorium on open air nuclear testing with an
astonishing series of test nuclear explosions in the fall of 1961,
which the Americans follow in turn. Indeed, the largest nuclear weapons ever
detonated in human history were detonated by the Soviet Union in the
fall of 1961. You remember in an earlier presentation, I
showed you the effects of a one megaton Soviet
nuclear blast. The Soviets are testing devices with 50
megatons of explosive power and beyond. So all of these interlocking issues, Cuba,
Berlin, whether or not the Soviet missile power can be
believed, all converge in a set of decisions that Khrushchev
makes in May 1962 to try to reverse the course of the
Cold War. Khrushchev's master plan is this: He's going to secretly deploy scores of
nuclear ballistic missiles, intermediate range ones called
IRBMs and medium range ones called MRBMs, and actually tens of
thousands of Soviet troops to defend the bases and
defend Cuba. He's going to deploy them to Cuba, making
that a missile base right off shore with credible striking power in the United
States. Why? What good would that do? It would mean the United States could no
longer effectively defend Berlin. Wait, stop, what do you mean by that? The United States could not defend Berlin
with conventional forces. Everybody knew that. Berlin's right in the middle of East
Germany. The only way the United States defends
Berlin is with this threat: If you attack Berlin, that will be general
war. If you attack Berlin, we, the United States, will escalate to using nuclear
weapons. We, the Americans, will use nuclear
weapons first. That's the bluff that defends Berlin. So, how do you checkmate the American
bluff to start a nuclear war in defense of
Berlin? The way you checkmate that is saying, if you threaten to start a
nuclear war, I've got these dozens of missiles in Cuba right off your
shores that can devastate your country. That cancels out the American ability to
start that because the Soviet retaliatory capability
is just minutes away. At that point, the United States bluff
that defends Berlin, the bluff everyone was
debating about, becomes manifestly incredible. The western position in Berlin, therefore,
diminishes and Khrushchev works out a plan in which, after the missiles
are deployed, in November 1962, he's going to whip the
covers off, show the missiles, bring the Berlin issue
to a triumphant conclusion. He actually explains to the Americans,
later in 1962, that he is going to bring the Berlin issue to a head in November. He just doesn't tell the Americans that
when he brings the issue to a head in November, he plans to have these
missiles unveiled in Cuba as part of that move. That's Khrushchevï¿½s extraordinarily
ambitious plan, but you might then think, why would the Cubans go along with
this plan? The Cubans, after all, aren't asking for
nuclear missiles. Their worry is that that will make them a target, it won't help
defend them. But Khrushchev is convinced that because
he's giving so much other help to the Cubans to defend their country, in return
the Cubans will do this for the Soviets. And besides, Khrushchev will justify the
deployment as something that's just being done to defend
beleaguered Cuba. He's right about that. The Cubans do go along with the Soviet proposal, though they are confused about
why the Soviets were asking them to do this. They do go along, they accept the risk,
along with the Soviets. The plan goes ahead. As the Soviets begin moving these huge
amounts of military equipment into Cuba, the Americans, of course not
really believing that the Soviets would put nuclear missiles in
Cuba, because that would seem so rash, do notice that a lot of stuff is
going in. They have to decide how they're going to
react publicly to that. In September of 1962, Kennedy gives a press
conference where he says, in effect: I'm going to tolerate it if you're just giving
the Cubans conventional military supplies. Where I draw the line is, don't put in any
offensive systems there, by which he means missiles that can
strike the United States. He draws that line precisely because he's
been told by his intelligence officials that the
Soviets don't plan to do that. But at the very time he's drawing that
line, it's exactly what the Soviets are
intending to do. The ships are already on the way to do it.
But then what happens? The Soviet plan is discovered before
Khrushchev was ready to unveil it. He was going to unveil the deployment when
it was all ready in November. But after a prolonged argument about
whether to fly more of these risky reconnaissance flights, like
the one that had been shot down over the Soviet Union, advocates for
those flights win the argument. One flight goes over Cuba in the middle of
October. It spots the missiles being prepared for
deployment. The Soviets don't know their plan has been
discovered. The Americans know it. Now they have a chance to prepare their
own countermove, in secret, to try to regain the strategic initiative. And that brings us to Act Two of this
crisis. Kennedy is debating: Do I just invade
Cuba? Or do I throw some sort of blockade around
it and negotiate some deal with the Soviets to get the missiles out in
exchange for something else I'll give them in
return? As Kennedy is hosting this secret debate
among his advisers, he has an extraordinary meeting on Friday
morning, October 19, 1962. And because he was running a taping system in the
White House, and I was actually one of the people who
edited the transcripts that published this
material, I can take you in this time machine inside the White
House on that morning. Now here are the people in the room. Only five people in the room, President
Kennedy and his four military leaders, the chairman and other members of
the joint chiefs of staff. In that small group, Kennedy explains just how he sees
this problem. His explanation, the way he appreciates
this situation is complex, but rarely do you get such a deep glimpse into the way the leader of a superpower is appreciating a moment in
world history. So, let's go into this time machine and
listen to the way President Kennedy outlines the way
he's viewing the world at this moment when he's deciding between war and
peace on the morning of October 19th. I'm going to take you slowly through this,
because I want to take the time for you to understand
Kennedy's reasoning. Now first he'll start out by explaining
why he thinks the Russians did this. This is a very interesting habit of
Kennedy. He clinically, coldly empathizes with the
other guy, tries to work through their
calculations. He sees three reasons that they did this.
Let's listen to him explain the first one. >> Firstly, I think we ought to think
of why the Russians did this. Well, actually, it was a rather dangerous
but rather useful play of theirs. If we do nothing, they have a missile base
there with all the pressure that brings to bear on the United
States and damage to our prestige. >> Got that? Now, he's about to explain a second point, which is if he
does anything about the missiles, it gives the Soviets an opening to do it back to
him, except he'll do something about Cuba. They will retaliate on Berlin. And Berlin is really important to the
whole American position in Europe. And the Europeans regard Cuba as trivial.
Let's listen. >> If we attack, Cuba, the missiles, or Cuba,
in any way, then it gives them a clear, line to take Berlin, as they were able to do in
Hungary under the Anglo war in Egypt. We will have been regarded as--they think
we've got this fixation about Cuba anyway--we would be regarded as the
trigger-happy Americans who lost Berlin. We would have no support among our allies. We would affect the West Germansï¿½ attitude
towards us. And that we let Berlin go because we
didn't have the guts to endure a situation in Cuba. After all, Cuba is 5, 6,000 miles from
them. They don't give a damn about Cuba. And they do care about Berlin and about
their own security. So they would say that we endangered their
interests and security and reunification and all the rest, because of the
preemptive action that we took in Cuba. So I think they've got...I must
say I think it's a very satisfactory position
from their point of view. If you take the view that what really. And thirdly, If we do nothing then they'll they'll have these missiles and they'll be
able to say that any time we ever try to do anything about Cuba, that they'll fire
these missiles. So that I think it's dangerous, but rather
satisfactory, from their point of view. >> Now, Kennedy reveals to you the
basic premise behind this analysis. >> If you take the view, really, that's
what's basic to them is Berlin and there isn't
any doubt. In every conversation we've had with the
Russians, that's what...Even last night we talked about Cuba for a
while, but Berlin--that's what Khrushchev's
committed himself to personally. So, actually it's a quite desirable
situation from their point of view. >> Now letï¿½s listen to Kennedy explain
to the Joint Chiefs how he's worked through the
policy options. The advantage of acting, but also the
danger of acting. Because if he acts, whatever he does,
whether it's a strike or a blockade, he fears the Soviets will do
exactly the same thing back at Berlin. Let's listen. >> That's what makes our problem so
difficult. If we go in and take them out on a quick
air strike, we neutralize the chance of danger to the United States
of these missiles being used, and we prevent a
situation from arising, at least within Cuba, where the Cubans
themselves have the means of exercising some degree of
authority in this hemisphere. On the other hand, we increase the chance
greatly, as I think they-- there's bound to be a reprisal from the
Soviet Union, there always is-- of their just going in and taking Berlin
by force at some point. Which leaves me only one alternative,
which is to fire nuclear weapons--which is a hell of an alternative--and begin a
nuclear exchange, with all this happening. On the other hand, if we begin the
blockage that we're talking about, the chances are they will begin a blockade
and say that we started it. And there'll be some question
about the attitude of the Europeans. So that, once again, they will say that there will
be this feeling in Europe that the Berlin blockade has
been commenced by our blockade. So I don't think we've got any
satisfactory alternatives. When we balance off that our problem is
not merely Cuba but it is also Berlin and when we
recognize the importance of Berlin to Europe, and
recognize the importance of our allies to us, that's the what has
made this thing be a dilemma for three days.
Otherwise, our answer would be quite easy. >> So it looks like Kennedy's stuck,
there's nothing he can do. Except Kennedy also recognizes that he has
to do something or else Khrushchev's plan to spring this is November and win
the Berlin Crisis will succeed. Let's listen. >> On the other hand, we've got to do
something, because if we do nothing, we're going to have the
problem of Berlin anyway. That was very clear last night. We're going to have this thing stuck right
in our guts in about two months. And so we've got do something. >> So what is Kennedy going to do?
Does he attack, or does he negotiate? The answer actually is he develops a third, middle option, a fusion that's
developed by a few of his advisors between just
blockade and negotiate and a strike and an
invasion. Instead, it's a blockade, but the blockade
is a first step that might lead to an
invasion. It's a blockade and an ultimatum. I'm stopping this thing with a blockade. You get those missiles out or else. Clearly implied is a readiness to attack
Cuba and start a war if the Soviets do not withdraw their
missiles. The world understands that it's just been taken to the brink of the nuclear war it's been dreading for more
than ten years. Then the next stage of the crisis becomes
the spring of the American move. The Americans launch a diplomatic
offensive. The Soviets don't know that their plan has
been unmasked by the Americans, so it's their turn to be caught off-guard when the Americans hit them with a diplomatic
offensive with all the Latin American countries
inside the United Nations. Envoys sent to the nations of Western
Europe, all explaining the American move, rallying
international support. At the same time they're orchestrating an
extraordinarily difficult naval blockade of Cuba to freeze the situation and keep
more missiles from coming in. That itself puts in motion an enormous
movement of military forces, heightened states of
alert as the military machines move closer to war and
it becomes harder and harder to control them, raising
the risk that war might break out through
inadvertent actions or accident. That brings us then to act three of the
crisis. In Act Three, Moscow, first of all reacts.
Caught off guard, their first inclination is: We're going to
have to step down somehow, but how do we salvage some measure of our
prestige? The Americans, meanwhile, are worried
about not letting the situation freeze so that the missiles already in Cuba become a
kind of fait accompli. How do they keep edging this along so this situation doesn't harden into one where
they've got this standoff. Then comes Saturday, October 27th, the
most dangerous day of the crisis. Castro expects an invasion, he's already ready for war. The Soviet military commanders on the
scene sympathize with this, and as American
surveillance aircraft continue to fly over Cuba, the Soviets, as well as the Cubans, start shooting at
them. One of the American aircraft, another U2,
is shot down. Its pilot is killed. Meanwhile, another American surveillance
aircraft on a totally unrelated matter blunders into Soviet airspace, is
chased by Soviet aircraft and is able to escape. Meanwhile, the forces of the two sides are
coming closer to confrontation. Castro's writing a letter to Khrushchev,
which some historians call the Armageddon letter, essentially
saying the invasion is coming, you might as well get ready for a nuclear
war with the Americans. As Khrushchevï¿½s absorbing all of this, the Americas are saying, gee we were
prepared to end this crisis on terms in which we agree not to invade Cuba, which is what you said you're interested in
doing. On October 28th, alarmed that the
situation is getting out of hand, Khrushchev capitulates and says he's
going to withdraw the missiles. The Americans had quietly said, by the way
you've raised an issue having to do with some of our
missiles in Turkey. We're not going to do some negotiated deal
about that in which we have quid pro quo. But we're going to get those missiles out
of Turkey eventually. Let's just get that off the table. All that, too, is part of the settlement. What happens, then, is the world sighs with
relief. Castro is fuming with rage. The deal that would have gotten the
missiles out of Cuba with United Nation's verification
immediately falls apart. And then that brings us to some of the
aftermath. In the aftermath, there's actually a quiet
crisis for nearly a month. Since Castro has blown up the original
deal, the Americans and the Soviets quietly negotiate a way
for the Soviet missiles to leave, for the Americans to
monitor that without Cuban cooperation and an understanding of
what stuff has to go. The Soviets, meanwhile, are also deciding that they're not going to publicize the business about American missiles in
Turkey. They're not going to do things to
embarrass the American government. They really are going to climb down. The crisis becomes an enormous turning
point. Well for one thing, the world is saved
from global war, from World War III. But for another, with both superpowers
having stepped up to the brink, there's clearly some sense that we need to
keep this from happening. We need to do more to try to start
managing the arms race. Those kinds of tensions slowly, slowly
begin to diminish. In Europe, the Berlin Crisis simply comes
to an end. It comes to an end with no grand flourish,
and no noise. The Soviets simply don't make that move in November '62 that they've been planning to
make. They simply say by 1963, well, we built the Berlin
Wall. That's enough. There is no more Berlin Crisis. In effect the Soviets quit trying to do anything to change the status quo in
Europe. In Europe, the Cold War settles down into
grim routine. That means that the basic emphasis of
superpower confrontation goes back to proxy battles in the Third World. So, with a little bit of sigh of relief of
our own, that's the subject we'll be talking
again about next time. See you then.
