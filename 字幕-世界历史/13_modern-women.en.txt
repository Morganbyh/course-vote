Hi.
Welcome back. The period of the 1910s and the
1920s features an enormous debate all over the world about women, and about what
it meant to be a modern woman. Let's talk some about that. And let's, first of all, think a little
bit about why this debate is happening at this
particular time. So you start, first of all, with debate about women's rights. Default position is, of course, that in
the 1800s, all over the world, almost all women were still in traditional
roles. Almost all people lived in rural lives, agricultural settlements,
hunter-gatherer communities. And in those communities, for generations,
all kinds of roles been assigned. They vary a lot. And you can an argument that, in some ways,
women's roles were as important as the menï¿½s, or more important;
it can vary from place to place. But there can be very little argument
about the fact that in a legal, formal sense, when these
traditional societies interacted with formal public systems of
law, the role of the women was often
subordinate, subordinate, for instance, in rights to
own property and rights to be treated equally if there was
a court case of some kind. So, often these traditional roles of
subordination took very concrete forms. Take, for example, the case of China. In China, after a period in which women
had had very large roles in society, in the Song Dynasty between, say, the
years about 900 and 1100, women began binding and compressing the size of their
feet. What had been a peculiar fashion
convention of the 11th or 12th century, becomes by the 17th, 18th, and 19th
centuries a ritualized and mandatory custom for all upper-class
women, or women who aspired to be upper-class women.
Literally from childhood, crushing their feet to fit in tiny little
shoes. Three, four inches long. Here's a photograph that shows you a
Chinese woman in 1900. Very typical, with bound feet and
traditional shoes. This is actually a very graceful way of
showing what had been done to her feet to make them fit in these, three or
four inch long little pointy shoes. The effect of Chinese women, millions and millions of them crushing
their feet in these ways, would of course be that physically, they were
just not equal to men. They could not walk normally.
In the most literal way, they could not keep up with men. In fact, one of the great causes of
Western missionaries in China in the late 1800s was to do everything they could
to eliminate the custom of foot binding. And by the early 1900s, the elimination of
foot binding became a cause for Chinese
liberals as well. So you have women in their traditional
roles. And in the late 1800s, there is a large and escalating fight for women to get equal
political rights. One of the questions we always want to
keep asking ourselves not just why, but why then?
Why not in the 1700s? Why not in the 1600s? What's going on in the late 1800s that might make arguments about political
rights for women more influential than they had been in the
past? Let's think about that for a moment. Hm, well one factor that we could, we said
that liberal ideas were reaching a zenith of popular acceptance, especially in
Europe and the United States, by the 1860s. Connected very much to that was the
anti-slavery movement. If former slaves will be given equal
political rights, made citizens, given the right to vote, shouldn't women be considered at least as
equal as former slaves? In fact, you'll note that in the late
1800s a lot of the same people who were very
active in anti-slavery movements were also very
active in trying to get political rights for women. Although the advocates of political rights
for women were accused of wanting to overthrow traditional society, mainly
their focus was on equal political rights. They weren't trying to more or less
overthrow the roles of women, though some radicals
might. In general though, they just thought that
women, staying in their traditional roles, should at least be allowed to have equal political rights just as a matter of
principle. Here's an example of a political poster from suffragettes in England in the
1910s. Of course, the man who has the vote is sailing along, the woman is rowing hard
because she's handicapped. Of course, not having the vote.
United States in 1913.
Women are going to march for suffrage. Or even in Japan in the 1920s.
Japanese women picking up the liberal ideals
that animate a constitutional monarchy with a parliament, with people voting,
also begin asking for a right to vote. But it wasn't just a matter of principle. Women also wanted the right to vote to
protect themselves. That's a very interesting point. Why would women feel a particular need to
protect themselves that's more salient in the late 1800s or
early 1900s than earlier? And just think about it.
Like what's changing in society? There are a couple of things that are
changing. One is, for instance, big cities. Urbanization for the first time in human
history. And what was happening in those big cities is the construction of
saloons. Think about it. If your husband was on the farm, it wasn't
as easy for him to run off and get drunk with a
hundred other men. Or if he got drunk, he was doing it on the
farm. Men going to the saloons, the way liquor is destroying their husbands and therefore wrecking their
families, is a huge theme of what women are
agitating about in the late 1800s, and one reason they need to get the right
to vote is to begin enacting laws that ban or
restrict the sale of alcohol. Here's one cartoon by an opponent. This one in Hawaii. Water cure back then was a synonym for
torture, for what we would nowadays call waterboarding,
and here's this woman you can see the pejorative depiction of her,
that's torturing this poor brewer. On the hose it says W-C-T-U: that stands for Womenï¿½s Christian Temperance Union. Over here, in the background, the Anti-Saloon
League. But it wasn't just temperance that women
were worried about. Women also needed the vote to protect
their working conditions. Another big feature, late 1800s, early
1900s, women are in the workplace. In those cities, women are working in
factories, in sweatshops as seamstresses. A notorious case, in New York in 1911, was
the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire. Hundreds of women, working in horrific
conditions, find themselves caught in a building that
catches on fire. Hundreds die.
Many of them leaping to their deaths. Women need the vote, they argued, so that they can pass laws to protect other women
from industrial abuse. If the cutting-edge issue of the 1910s
in the relationship of women to society is political rights, what I want to look
at now are the origins of modern feminism. Most scholars of modern feminism would
place its origins, especially in Britain and America, around the 1910s
and the 1920s. What's going on? Now, in addition to political rights, women are talking more and more about
emancipation. A broader kind of freedom.
What does emancipation mean? Well, actually that's an argument that's
still going on today. Ask yourself what you think emancipation
might mean to a woman of 1920. For her, it might just mean emancipation
from being locked into traditional roles. Now it's not just about formal civil
rights, now it is about the social place of women. Women are finding themselves in the
workplace; they're working in factories; they're working in office; they're
avant-garde magazine editors in New York City. They're doing all kinds of things. They want to imagine a different kind of
independent lifestyle for themselves. Also, emancipation from traditional sexual
roles; a key element of this sort of emancipation
is actually the right to control whether they get pregnant
and give birth to children. If you were to look into: Well, when does
modern birth control or organizations like
Planned Parenthood have their start? You'd be looking at exactly this period of
time. You'd be looking, for example, at people
like Margaret Sanger, the founder of modern birth control in the
United States. One of the most influential figures for the spread of birth control worldwide.
She was put on trial in the 1910s even for talking about the subject of
birth Control, as if that was something that was
obscene. But notice, this issue put out by the American Birth Control League, a
forerunner of Planned Parenthood. This magazine is from 1919. Notice the argument, dedicated to
voluntary motherhood. The cover sketch, there's a nurse. The woman is saying must she always plead
in vain. You are a nurse, can't you tell me?
For the children's sake, help me. In other words, can't the nurse give this
woman advice on how she can become a voluntary
mother. How shall we change the law? That's one kind of emancipation, but
another form of emancipation, if you will, is equal opportunity, including
equal opportunity in the workplace. Equal opportunity to enter the
professions. These are also increasingly pressing
issues for the agenda of modern feminism. Not just political rights.
In the 1910s, 20s, 30s, and beyond.
The conditions of society have changed. Women are finding themselves in new
places. They're now trying to adjust the whole
social expectation of women to match. The characteristic popular understanding
of this in the 1920s is typified by the image of the modern
girl. We here in America might think of the
modern girl just in this image of the American flapper. Here, for example, is an American film
actress in 1926. But this is not just about America; these modern girls are showing up all over the
world. They're showing up in Germany, in iconic
images like this one. They're showing up in Japan, in this image in a beer advertisement. They're showing up in China, where modern
girls insist for example, at the most literal
level, they will no longer bind and crush their
feet; they will be able to walk like ordinary
people; they will wear western cosmetics; they'll
fashion their hair along Western styles. But they'll adapt western styles in
traditional Chinese ways. You see the dresses they're wearing are a fusion of Western and Eastern style,
to form the image of the Shanghai girls on the cover of this
recent best-selling novel. How's this happening? In a way, it's useful to think about transmission belts of modern styles, of
modern culture. Sure, movies, things like that.
Magazines. But all over the world there are
particular cities that are kind of bridge points
between East and West, places in which these styles are communicated, developed.
So for instance, if you were to go to Asia, places like Tokyo, like Shanghai, like Saigon, in French Indochina, the city now called
Ho Chi Minh City. Or, Djakarta, the capital of the Dutch East
Indies. In all of these places East met West, the most modern Western conveniences,
consumer goods, cosmetics, styles, advertising is meeting these local
cultures, and you are seeing the results of some of these
fusions. But one of them is that women in all these
places are trying out a modern, independent style which then
becomes a lightning rod for public controversy about what it all
means. You'll notice how a lot of these modern
girls are very much about the consumerism,
perfumes, cars, cigarettes, fashions. There's also an aspect of defining the modern girl that's
precisely a reaction to that consumerism. Take for instance this image from the new
Soviet Union. That's also modern girl, but she wouldn't
be a modern girl... she'd be a modern worker.
You see? Their argument was that communism was also
about the liberation of women, that women were joining alongside with
men as workers in the factory. So, you see, this modern woman is being
careful not to wear Western cosmetics. Not to wear brand name Western clothes. She's emphasizing her modern identity, not
only as a worker, but as a fellow comrade. So far, we've talked about political
turmoil, communism versus anti-communism, an age of uncertainty,
changing roles between men and women. Now, next time let's just sort of take
stock and look around the world of 1930. See you then.
