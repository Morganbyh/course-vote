Hi, welcome back. So we've been talking about a crisis of
capitalism, a crisis in the West in the 1970s, a thrashing about, looking for new
ideas to get out of the malaise. What you see is some New Thinking in the
West. The democratic socialist alternative is
faltering, as other revolutionary ideas have developed, really, in a way, a
renaissance of liberalism. I mean, liberalism in the terms we've been
using it all through this course, not the way in which it's conventionally used in American
political life. For instance, economic liberalism, the
notion that instead of larger government control over
the economy, instead the answers might be to retreat from a government role in the
economy. No single person was more influential as
an advocate of economic liberalism in the 1970s than that very gentle,
avuncular fellow, Milton Friedman. Now, for you to just have to get a sense of what
Freidman was like and the kind of impact he had on
people in the 1970s, here's a film clip of Friedman appearing
on public television in New York City in
1975. I'll just give you about the first two and
a half minutes of this. You'll be able to get a sense both of the argument, and of the man.
Let's take a look. >> I'm Richard Hefner, your host on The
Open Mind. My guest today has been labeled this
country's foremost conservative economist. Milton Friedman of the University of
Chicago, of Newsweek magazine, and of wherever it is that
persons of brilliance and concern gather to discuss
the fate of individual liberty in the midst of ever
expanding governmental responsibilities. Professor Friedman, I wonder if I might
begin the program by saying that you're a kind and a gentle
man, yet you're identified by many with those who see, to
those who make that identification to want us not to do
kind and gentle things. Perhaps not provide for the poor, perhaps
not provide for the aged, and I wonder how you'd reconcile these phenomena and
whether you feel that it's fair to characterize you as a conservative economist. >> Well, let me start at the end of
that first. I never characterize myself as a
conservative economist. As I understand the English language,
conservative means conserving, keeping things as they
are. I don't want to keep things as they are. The true conservatives today are the
people who are in favor of ever bigger
government. The people who call themselves liberals
today, the New Dealers, they are the true conservatives because
they want to keep going on the same path we're going
on. I would like to dismantle that. I call myself a liberal in the true sense
of liberal, in the sense in which it means of and
pertaining to freedom. Now, that brings me to your second point.
One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their
intentions rather than their results. We all know a famous road that is paved
with good intentions. The people who go around talking about
their soft heart, I, I share their I admire them for the
softness of their heart. But unfortunately, it very often extends
to their head as well, because the fact is, that the programs that are labeled as
being for the poor, for the needy, almost always have effects exactly the
opposite of those which their well-intentioned sponsors
intend them to have. >> Friedman, in fact, was quite
consciously borrowing from an older intellectual tradition, especially a
group of people in Central Europe, like this Austrian economist
Friedrich Hayek and the book that he had written that was so
influential in the 1940s. Converging with this economic argument is
also a political argument about the importance of liberty, about the
importance of human rights. It just so happened that in the late 1970s
and early 1980s, these issues and arguments
about liberty and human rights are taken up both on the left wing
and on the right wing of American and West
European politics. No one more personifies this peculiar
alliance than the figure of the Polish Pope, John Paul II. The particular time at which he became the
Pope, the way he represented the aspirations of liberty,
for people in Poland, the symbol that he provided for aspirations of
liberty around the world, and the way in which that was being held
back by the Soviet Union and its Polish government
allies, that gives you a sense of the fusion of
how political liberty, political liberalism,
is crossing some of the usual party boundaries to become a powerful idea
of its own at the end of the 1970s and beginning of
the 1980s. Also factoring in to the popular support for some of these movements is that
yearning for public order that I mentioned in my
last presentation-- a reaction to the violence, the terrorist
movements of the 1970s and also the shadow of the USSR, the fact
that with America out of Vietnam, with America
on the defensive, it begins to be the Soviet Union that, at
least for a little while, is looking more like
the world's bully. In a way then, this revolution that I'm describing in the
1970s and early ï¿½80s is a kind of revolution of small
business folk, of shopkeepers, and no one seemed to
exemplify their aspirations more than the grocer's
daughter, Margaret Thatcher in England. So let's look at some of the key political
turns in this period. I especially want to focus attention on
Europe, because that was such a key battleground
area in the struggle between East and West. In Italy and Spain, the communists come
close to gaining power, but they do not succeed. They are turned back at the ballot box. On the other hand, Thatcher wins election
in 1979, offering the British public a clear
alternative. Here's Time magazine noting the victory of
Britain's fighting lady. Thatcher's victory is followed at the end of 1980, with the
triumph of Ronald Reagan ascending to the American
presidency in 1980. In 1981, Francois Mitterrand takes power
in France. And then one might think that there's a
different direction being followed here, because as I said in my last presentation,
Mitterrand is a French socialist. In 1981, he forms a ruling coalition in
partnership with the communist party, but in 1982
Mitterrand decides to align with German partners, even with the
British to some degree. He's firmly anticommunist on political
matters, on economic matters he's decided to recoil from nationalizing the big banks, from pursuing the democratic socialist
policies. He decides France just can't afford it. Instead it needs to join a European
consensus that will reboot capitalism, not try to turn Europe
toward democratic socialism. Mitterrand's conversion in 1982 then
becomes a big part of this emerging trend. But no country perhaps was more important
at the beginning of the 1980s in determining the future of
Western Europe than West Germany. In West Germany, the Social Democrats were led in the 1970s by someone who was very much a social democrat on
economic issues, but very pro-NATO and anti-Soviet
in his international stance, strong on defense issues, that was
Helmut Schmidt. Schmidt had to govern in an alliance with
Germany's liberal party, that is, Germany's small government
party, the Free Democrat Party, whose major figure was this man,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Just to give you a sense of how precarious
the balance was in West German politics, here's a basic electoral map that shows you
the outcome of the German elections in three
years. A quick review of the numbers and you can
see that it's the small liberal party that holds
the balance of power. And in the 1970s, they're governing in coalition with Schmidt and his Social
Democrats. What turns Germany in a decisive
direction, and brings the political and economic issues back together again,
is actually a crisis over missiles. What basically happened here is the
Soviets during the 1970s deployed a much more modern set of long range ballistic missiles from the
Soviet Union that could target sites all through
Western Europe. Some Western European leaders looked at
these missiles and thought, this essentially disables our flexible
response strategy, where we would start a nuclear war if the Soviets started a
conventional one, because they could hold all our places
hostage with their missiles. Therefore we need the Americans to bring
missiles to Europe that, from bases in Western Europe, can strike
the Soviet Union to keep the United States's security from being decoupled from the security of Western
Europe. That sounds a little bit, complicated. It is. But the bottom line is West German leaders
like Helmut Schmidt are asking the Americans to deploy missiles to Germany.
Schmidt makes that pitch. It comes at a moment in which he already
has a lot of tensions with Jimmy Carter over a lot of other issues. At the end of 1979, NATO decides to approve
this deployment. It'll hold out the possibility of arms
control with the Soviets, but it's going to go ahead with the
deployment, which is to be completed by the end of 1983. This particular military issue just became
an enormous symbol of confrontation over the political
future of Europe. By the way, here is a photograph, there's
the SS-20 Soviet missile on the left, the planned American Pershing II
missile on the right. The Social Democratic Party, led by
Schmidt, moves leftward. It does not want to go along with this
missile deployment, which it thinks will make Europe an atomic
battlefield in between the superpowers. What they want are agreements against
arms. You just see the firm red bar on top of
missiles, that's what the SPD says it wants to stand for.
At this point in Germany, in the early 1980s, politics is becoming polarized,
issues of economic liberalism and political alignment, pro or
against NATO, are blurring together. The German liberal party abandons its
coalition with the Social Democrats. That small liberal party, instead aligns
itself with the Christian Democrats, kind of the national
conservatives of German politics. Why? Because the liberals are increasingly
alarmed, that the Social Democrats have economic policies that will
just enlarge the size of government, which the liberals are
against, and increasingly they're worried that the
Social Democrats are against NATO. From the Social Democratic point of view, this whole business of NATO
versus Warswaw Pact is the wrong way to think about it. It's the superpowers against the rest of
us, who might be their victims. Well, those are the issues that are
going to divide the German public. And they go through an intense period of
huge public debate, demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of people, all
through the streets of German cities. The leader of the new German government, in 1982, is
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Kohl, in turn, has been leading an
intellectual movement in German conservatism called a sort of
Tendenzwende, in which they're seizing on the ideological differences between
East and West to reassert the salience of these differences, to the
importance of aligning with NATO. No, they are not all alike. The West does stand for ideals, and the
East does not. They point to issues of the suppression of
unrest in Poland, of Soviet behavior around the
world to strengthen their case. Well, anyway, that's the choice, the West
German people are facing in 1982 and 1983. Choices like this are being faced in
Britain, France, Italy, the United States.
It makes 1981, ï¿½82, ï¿½83, intense years of domestic and international crisis.
Just to set the scene: Europe is also, Central Europe, Germany,
the most heavily militarized part of the
entire planet. Hundreds of thousands of heavily armed
soldiers facing each other across the inter-German border, and
there are flash points for potential conflict all
over the world. The Polish government and its Soviet
allies have had to declare martial law in Poland to
put down unrest led by the labor union
Solidarity and inspired by the example of the Polish
Pope. The Soviet war in Afghanistan against the
Afghan resistance grinds on. There's economic crisis, domestic and global, from both the high
unemployment and the high inflation that's plaguing all
the developed countries. Meanwhile, in the less developed world,
they can't pay for the imports anymore as oil prices have
gotten so high. They borrowed a lot of money to pay for
it, and then the interest rates that they have to pay on
those loans are going up. There's a huge debt crisis, too, in the
Third World. Countries are threatening to go bankrupt. In 1982, the Argentine government seizes a
set of islands off the coast of Argentina called the Falkland
Islands, long held by Great Britain. Great Britain prepares a navy and an
expeditionary army and sends it across the North Atlantic and the South Atlantic to
wage war to reconquer the Falkland Islands from Argentina.
That's 1982. There's the Euromissile crisis tearing up
the politics all across Western Europe. There is intense conflict in Central
America, civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua, the threat and confrontation between the
United States and Cuba and maybe even the Soviet Union. So here's the scene of that struggle.
There's El Salvador, and Honduras and Guatemala are also
getting caught up in this conflict, too. And again, the issue seems polarizing because the anti-communist forces in El
Salvador and Nicaragua are committing all kinds of human rights violations, right wing death
squads. So, if you're anti-communist it looks like you're lining up with right wing death
squads. But if you're for the insurgence, are you
also on the side of the Cubans? So, if you're beginning to get a sense of
tension from all of this, you're recovering the
mood of the early 1980s, and it comes to a head in
1983, really the most intense year of
international crisis since 1962. Using these wonderful Time magazine
covers, I'm just going to give you a set of snapshots, just to give you a feel for
the turmoil of that year. Brezhnev dies, a new leader takes charge in the Soviet Union at
the end of 1982, Yuri Andropov, he was the head of the Soviet secret police, the KGB.
Third world debt problems: the looming bankruptcy of countries all
across Latin America and other parts of the
world. That's the debt bomb Time Magazine is
writing about in January 1983 as banks had loaned people money to pay
their higher oil import bills and then the loans came
due. Meanwhile, the Euromissile crisis is
intensifying. The two sides seem to be playing nuclear
poker as the stakes get higher. You see the conflict of Central America, spotlighted here in May 1983, while Reagan
proclaims America has a vital interest, a moral duty to assist the anti-communist
resistance in Nicaragua. And Time is still noting problems in the
Atlantic alliance. [LAUGH] This cover may have spoken for a
lot of Americans by June of 1983 and the way they were feeling from reading all of this -- and more turmoil over Central
America. By August of 1983, still more trouble in
Central America. In September of 1983, a Korean Airlines
passenger jet carrying hundreds of passengers strayed accidentally over
Soviet airspace in Siberia. The Soviets sent up fighter jets to
intercept it and simply shot it down, killing all the
hundreds of people aboard. You can imagine the global reaction as the
United States plays tapes of the Soviet air controllers
getting word from the fighter aircraft that the target is
destroyed. Meanwhile, there is a proxy war going on
in Lebanon, where American troops had gone onto the ground to try to help solve
problems in a long running civil war. The American troops are being pressured by
local forces backed by Syria, backed by the
Soviet Union. In Lebanon, in the fall of 1983, it looks like the Marines are holding the
line helping to prop up one side in the civil war, but the Syrians and their allies aren't
done yet. With Hezbollah, they blow up Marine
barracks outside of Beirut. More than 200 Marines are killed.
As the United States asks itself questions about whether to get out of
Lebanon, the United States sends a small force to invade the tiny Caribbean island
of Grenada where a left wing dictator, possibly aligned with
Cuba, has just taken power. The escalating crisis in Lebanon seems to
put the United States on a road to possible war against Syria, then
lead by Hafez Assad. Yes, that's the same Assad family whose
son has been ruling Syria during the recent civil
war there. But if the United States clashes with
Syria, it will face Soviet fighter jets and Soviet anti-aircraft
missiles that are protecting Syria, another danger of
conflict. And at the end of the year, the Soviets
walk out of the arms control negotiations that were trying to manage
the disputes over the deployments of the Euromissiles. And there were some other things going on
behind the scenes. The Soviets were getting erroneous
intelligence telling them that a NATO exercise in the fall of 1983 might even be preparations for a
possible US or NATO attack on the Soviet Union. As tensions, perhaps, seemed to be
spiraling out of control, there was an increasing sense, on both sides, US and Soviet, that
they needed to take a step back. The popular culture is full of the
nightmares of what might be coming. You can see this evidenced by this huge
bestselling book about what might happen if the Soviets
invaded Western Europe. This book published in the end of the
1970s was still being read all through the early
1980s. In America, a powerful television drama
called The Day After showed just what might
happen in America after a nuclear war. Ronald Reagan himself watched this film
and was moved by it, shaken by it. Other films even speculated about the
scenario of a Soviet invasion of the United States, accompanied by their Cuban allies such as this movie, Red Dawn, from which there has
recently been a silly remake trying to invent new invaders
of the United States. Or this reaction, this is a movie in
which, of course, young people, Matthew Broderick
and his girlfriend, try to save the world from an accidental
nuclear war created by the war machines getting
out of control. In the 1984 election year, Ronald Reagan and his
advisers want to project an image of strength to the
American people, but they also know that the American
people want to elect someone who is interested in
peace as well. In effect, voters in Europe and in the
United States are going to make some choices in this polarized battle of ideas
symbolized by this TIME cover showing Reagan and
Andropov and their confrontation as the dominant
story of the year. Thatcher, Kohl, Reagan, all get huge
momentum coming from their vindication in those
elections. Look at the results here in the German
elections. In 1983, clearly the German voters support
the Christian Democrats. The liberals' share dwindles. The Social Democrats dwindle even more,
with many voters simply defecting to the anti-missile, pro-
environment Green Party. Margaret Thatcher, the same year,
triumphantly wins re-election, propelled by her victory over
Argentina, her victory over the miners, she seems to
be the reassuring figure Britons want. Kohl re-elected, Thatcher re-elected, and at the end of 1984, Reagan is re-elected,
too, winning 49 out of 50 states. And in the Soviet Union, by contrast, Yuri
Andropov dies. He's replaced by another leader,
Konstantin Chernenko, who within a year is also dead. So there's a sense of domestic momentum,
there's also a sense of international momentum, one side
moving, the other side falling backward. But another key element of this story is
what's going on with capitalism anyway? How was capitalism doing? Capitalism survived. In fact, capitalism
Reboots, and it's that story that we'll be coming to next
time. See you then. [BLANK_AUDIO]
