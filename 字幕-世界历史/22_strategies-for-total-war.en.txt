[BLANK_AUDIO] Welcome back.
Last time, we talked about how, in 1940, ï¿½41, and into 1942, powers launched
desperate gambles to try to secure complete victory without being plunged
into prolonged, total global war. That really on both sides, these gambles
have failed. By ï¿½41- ï¿½42, they now have to size up their
capabilities and their strategies to wage and win a
prolonged total and global war. And it's those strategies and capabilities
we're going to analyze in detail now. To try to get at the question, why did the
Allies win? In a total war, in a struggle for
survival, several issues are being tested. Which model of government will be most
effective in mobilizing its resources to pass the ultimate test of survival in a
conflict like this? Among the inherent potential in your
society, a given population, a certain amount of
industrial plant, kind of a GDP, so to speak, who will do the best job of mobilizing the latent
potential of their society? And, kind of intriguingly, when you do
that, when you find ways to mobilize your
society in this way for total war, what do you turn your society into by achieving
that goal? Let's look at the way the three critical
powers chose their strategies. Fundamentally, Germany chose to wage a war
of ruthless annihilation. What the Germans called a Vernichtungskrieg.
The Nazis have a vision of a New Order, one in which the master race will be on
top, all the others subordinated
below. They have a huge area of Europe under
their control during 1942. This map gives you a pretty good picture
of it. Just pause and think a little bit about,
what's the population count for all the people that are under German rule? What's the potential GDP that the Germans
could have mobilized for their war effort, if they had done the maximum possible job of mobilizing those potential resources
for the war? And the answer is pretty scary. It's just an enormous amount of resources
potentially available. But of course, part of what happens, when
you're a master race subjugating others, is you don't do a very
good job of building coalitions or partnerships with
potential allies in all of these places. Therefore, you don't do as good a job of mobilizing all the potential that was
there. Their imperial plans in the East are a
very good example of this. In parts of the Soviet Union, the German
forces were welcomed as liberators, because some of the people
hated Stalin so much. But of course as soon as their liberators start shooting
them, any possibility for an alliance becomes
impossible. You treat them as slaves, they're not
going to be your partners. And then finally from the perspective of
the people who hoped for the progress of human civilization, the Germans reimagine
what it is possible for nations and states to do. They actually begin envisioning the
extinction of entire populations of people they regard
as enemies or sub-humans. The Jews, first among them, but other kinds
of groups, too. The Germans indeed began embarking on a
final solution, or really a series of final solutions, of the Jewish
question in Europe. There were other populations, including
the Pols, who also were being exterminated in large numbers, but the Jewish problem for
Hitler and his cronies was unique. They didn't start with a master plan in which they always envisioned killing
centers, basically death factories. Instead they were going to get the Jews
out of the way, they were going to push them into the East, they
were going to resettle them in the East. Then they realize, hm, if we're invading
the Soviet Union, we're going to overrun places with
millions more Jews. What are we going to do with them? Then they start coming to the conclusion
then, well, those Jews, we're just going to kill them as we
find them. And they set up killing squads to do that. And so in 1941, they're killing Jews in the hundreds of thousands. In 1942, more than a million being killed
just by these killing squads. By, squads, lining people up in the
thousands and the tens of thousands and shooting
them. Then, they begin to realize, what do we do
with the Jews in the rest of Europe? And for that problem, and for the
remaining problem of the Jews under their control, they begin
actually constructing, in 1942, factories to kill people industrially. Something that states, human beings had
never embarked upon before. This really is achieving a new plane, a
depressing one, of human possibility. Now let's turn to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's survival in the war is
really worth some attention. The Soviet Union survives by truly envisioning the possibilities of the
communist Sparta, taking the notion of a command society to its ultimate logical
possibility, because really, after the initial
campaigns of 1941, this is an all-out war of attrition. Just muscle on muscle, numbers on numbers. And the thing that keeps surprising German
intelligence in 1942 is they keep thinking the Soviets should
be out of soldiers. Where are they getting more armies from?
We think we've destroyed them all. How can they keep building so many tanks?
Armies seem to appear out of nowhere. You see this on a lot of the German war
literature. But one of the intriguing things, when you
get into this a little bit more, is if you look at the Soviet inputs and
the German inputs. You look at what's the population and
gross domestic product available to the Soviet Union in
1941 and 1942? And what's the population and gross
domestic product available to the German empire and its allies in 1941
and 1942? Answer?
They're roughly comparable. Roughly comparable population, roughly comparable total gross
domestic product. Maybe the German empire, at least in
theory, has advantages. So then part of the great mystery of why the Soviet Union survives in 1942 is: How
do they get such astonishing outputs, so much
better than the Germans, from a roughly comparable set
of inputs? Let's just look at some of the numbers
here. Here's a chart for war production in 1941. This is unglamorous stuff, but in
industrial wars like this, it's brute force, it's firepower, that does an awful
lot to determine the outcome. Here are the production numbers in 1941,
measured in thousands. You see in every category the Soviets are
ahead. Yes, sometimes the quality of what they're producing is inferior to
the Germans. But actually, in some cases, the quality is
quite comparable. So, in 1941, from similar inputs, the
Soviets still outproduced the Germans. But even more astonishing are the figures
in 1942. Because remember 1941, it's as if the
Soviets have had their left arm torn off. A large part of the industrial part of
their country has been occupied by the Germans.
You'd expect their numbers to go way down. They go way up. Look at these contrasts in war production
in 1942, while the Germans are occupying a large portion
of Soviet territory. And then you ask yourself: How is this
possible? How can the Soviets be doing this again since the raw inputs are roughly
comparable? The first level of explanation is just
that the Soviets just do a much better job of mobilizing their
resources than the Germans do. They're both dictatorships, but you'd
think that would be equal. You'd be wrong. The Soviets have a better organized
dictatorship, a better organized command economy than the
Germans do. They're willing to demand more sacrifices
from their ordinary people. They're willing to do more to conscript
every available man, woman, and even mobile children to work in factories, to work in the
front, tapping everything they can. So at level one, frankly, communism is
better organized to turn its country into a Sparta than was the
case in Nazi Germany. But if you take that further and go to
level two, you see that the problem gets even
more interesting. How is it that the Soviets can turn their
entire economy into a war economy, producing
nothing but military equipment? You have make tradeoffs to do this. Because, gosh, don't we need people to
grow food? Don't we need people to produce some sort of, kind of, basic household goods and
consumer products? Make some kinds of necessary civilian
equipment? Aircraft, trucks, radios, things like
that. The Soviets don't need that as much, in part because here's where support
from countries like the United States, especially in 1942 but
then growing a lot in ï¿½43 and ï¿½44, make a difference. The Americans help, basically, release
people to work in the war factories because the Americans can help
supply some of these other products. Plus another factor the Soviets have in
their favor, is that the Soviets can concentrate all of their production, basically, on one zone of
combat. The Germans are having to juggle a couple
of additional zones of combat, though the Eastern front in ï¿½41 and ï¿½42 was claiming the vast majority of their
effort. The bottom line is that 1942 is the
critical year, is that in 1942 the Soviets are able to
leverage superior military production, more mobilized forces
in the field, to launch offensives that the Germans think the Soviets should
not be able to launch. And as the German offensive momentum
peters out, in places like Stalingrad, the Soviets
launch counteroffensives. Not all of them are successful. Some of them are bloody failures. But especially the one at Stalingrad is a
big success, and the tide of war begins to turn. And then when you get into 1943, more and
more the other inputs, especially from countries like America and Britain,
can make more and more of a difference, as also the American and British war
efforts are putting more pressure on the Germans on
other theaters, too. But it's useful to just keep in mind that,
for the Soviets in this war, it's still a pretty
close run thing. They do not have inexhaustible resources. By the end of 1945, when the war will end,
the Soviets have scratched the very bottom of the barrel in their
available manpower to man their armies. The costs to them of waging this
war are staggeringly enormous. Let's look at the problem of the United
States of America for a few minutes, their
strategic choices. The American situation is different yet
again. The Americans have a lot of different
commitments. Their job is how do we balance them? Let's take a look at the world in which the United States is juggling its
alliances and commitments. This map shows the situation at the end of
1942. So the Soviets are fighting one gigantic theater of operations, right
here. The Germans have that theater, and then
they have secondary efforts here in the Mediterranean, and a naval war they're
waging in the Atlantic with submarines. Plus a secondary effort increasingly
large, to protect their skies from aerial attack from the
British, and then the Americans.
So you can think for the Germans, a huge front and three secondary fronts.
Now think about the American problem.
The Americans, just in the Pacific, are mounting a major line of attack here, another one here, and a third here. Three major fronts in the Pacific. The actual combat forces at the edge of those spears are relatively small, but
with huge supply chains necessarily stretching
behind them because of the vast distances and difficult tropical
conditions involved. The Americans are also getting supplies to
the Soviets, here, here, which is why the Soviets and the Americans and British have jointly
occupied Iran.
And some here. The Americans, in addition to the three fronts
here, in addition to the effort to supply the Soviets, have a theater here in the
Mediterranean. An increasingly large theater, consumes a
lot of resources, to wage war over the skies of Germany.
Getting ready to launch an invasion here, waging a battle in the Atlantic here that
consumes huge resources to defeat the German submarine threat, and keep the
supply lines flowing across the Atlantic. As well as of course a submarine war in
the Pacific, too. This just begins to give you some sense in
which the Americans have an extraordinary problem of how to balance
their efforts across all of this, while retaining enough people in the
United States to run the factories and run the farms that are
going to produce all these goods that are making them the arsenal of the
Allied Powers all over the world. To organize this colossal effort, they
build a famous building called the Pentagon,
completed during World War II, which at that time was the largest
office building ever constructed in the history
of the world. What the Americans are doing, therefore, is
adopting a grand strategy where, instead of relying on
their own brute force, they're leveraging their power with
partners and alliances and commitments all over the
world. A little here, navy here, some soldiers
there, some airpower there, trucks and supplies here, to be able to a create
an overall fighting power to win the war. And as they're doing all of that juggling, the Americans are making some gambles of
their own. First, they're gambling that they can continue to keep the focus on Germany First, put their priority
there, and that a relatively secondary effort
in all the fronts against Japan will still be
good enough. The Americans make a second gamble that
they can do all this with a relatively small
army. They have a plan for how large their army
is going to be in 1941. They end up having to cut that plan
down by more than half. They have a plan for a navy, air force,
and an army. They cut the size of the planned army in half, but hold the navy and air force plan
intact. Because otherwise, there just simply
aren't enough people to go around. The Americans don't have an inexhaustible
supply of manpower, either, to do all of this and keep the factories
working. So they gamble that they can get by with a
relatively small army. Why? Because they're going to try to leverage
airpower leverage naval power, and leverage
the power of the Red Army, the Soviet army, to help
do the job in winning the war. A key strategic discussion that
re-emphasized Germany First, the commitment to
unconditional surrender, but also the commitment to a
heavy reliance on airpower was at this summit meeting between the
British and Americans in North Africa, at the end of 1942 and the
beginning of 1943. There's Roosevelt, here, with Churchill. Their military advisers, like General
Marshall, over here. The only other civilian in the room,
besides Roosevelt and Churchill, is Roosevelt's right hand
man, here, Harry Hopkins. The third American gamble, then, is to redouble the bet on airpower against
Germany. Interestingly, in 1942, the Allied bombing
campaign against Germany has been a bust. It's failing. Despite the fact that it's failing,
they're convinced it can do more, and as I say, they double down on
it. It doesn't do very well all through 1943,
either. But it does divert a lot of the German
effort. 30% of all the cannon barrels in the Third Reich are pointing at the skies of the
Third Reich. That's a big diversion of military effort. But by 1944, it turns out, the bombing
offensive does begin to have a tremendous impact on Germany. The Allies solved some problems about
fighter escort of their bombers, and then, fundamentally, they're able to
begin breaking down the German oil industries and
transportation industries and begin achieving significant strategic
effects in 1944, even aside from the diversion of German
military effort to defend their homeland against
air attack. But part of the whole reliance on firepower and technology to offset a
relatively small-sized army is the decision they make at around
the same time, that's late 1942-early 1943, to
make the biggest bet of all in a way: to bet that they can build an atomic bomb. They make this an extremely high priority that can claim resources above everybody
else, even though no one has ever proved, in a testing round,
that an atomic bomb can even be successfully
built and exploded. Only the Americans had, kind of, the scientific confidence, even bravado, to
think that they could pull this off and have the
resources to do it. A lot of other people looked at it.
The Japanese, the Germans. And basically decided: too hard. The Americans pushed the resources into
it, and an atomic bomb will be ready to use by the middle of
1945. So what we've done here is we've carried
the story of this total war, the largest war in human history, into its decisive phase. We've looked at the strategies and
capabilities of the key powers to ask ourselves the question: What are
the choices they made? What is it about their societies that
prepared them to win or pushed them on the path to defeat? We'll follow the way that story unfolds
next.
