[MUSIC] Hi I'm Maya, welcome to my kitchen. Today Milan and I are going to
make a summer sweet pea salad for you, right, Milan? >> What is that? >> The biggest challenge is getting
the salad made before the sweet peas all get eaten, so let's get started
>> First, I've got some nice boiling water and
a steamer basket. I'm just going to steam these
fresh peas that we shelled. You helped me, right? Were you my helper? We're going to pour them
into this steaming basket. And let them steam. >> Mama, why is water in there? >> Just for a minute or two. We don't want to over cook
them because they're so fresh that they actually cook
in just like a minute or two. So I've got some nice,
ice cold water here. You want to feel how cold this is? Very cold, right? Okay, so we're going to pull our peas
out because they've been in there for about a minute or two now. You can leave them up to three minutes,
you just don't want them to be overcooked. So I'm going to pull the lid off. And I'm going to lift up
my steamer basket and immerse it in the ice cold water. I'll turn this off. And we're just going to
give that a few minutes so that the peas come right
down to room temperature. If you take them out and let them cool,
they'll continue to cook. And then you'll have overcooked peas. [SOUND] And I'm actually just going to use
the same bowl that we shelled the peas in. [SOUND] And
I'm going to use this as my serving bowl. Less work for me to clean up. Okay, so it looks like the peas are cooled
now and I'm just going to pull them out. They're nice and cold. And I'm going to use the same
steamer basket to strain them. And I'm going to put them down on
a cloth and give them a little shake. See how they're shaking? >> Can I eat them? >> You can eat one. Is that good? [SOUND] Okay, so
we've got our barely cooked peas. I'm going to pour them
into this salad bowl. [MUSIC] Don't need that anymore. And now, we're going to dress it. Are you going to help me dress it? Okay hold on,
because we're going to make a salad. I told you, the trickiest part
is actually preserving the piece until they get to the table. They tend to disappear along the way. So, we're going to add,
in no specific order, our calamari olives,
some sheep's milk feta. Some nice finely chopped green onions,
or scallions some people call them. And then a drizzle of olive oil. Mm, smells so good. Some fresh lemon juice, and a touch of lemon rind,
just to give it that added lemony flavor. It's such a summery salad this,
it's so light. The last thing I'm going to
do is add a touch of salt. You don't need a lot because
you've got the olives and- >> And that. >> The feta cheese is also salty. >> And that. >> And some of this,
do you want to do this? Will you do the pepper for me? [MUSIC] We've got our pepper here. This is my sous chef. Thank you, sir, thank you, sous chef. And then I'm just going to toss it up. Mm-hm, what a nice summer salad. There you have it ladies and gentlemen. The easiest summer salad you'll ever make. I'm Maya, thanks for joining me. Hope to see you again soon. Are you going to say goodbye to everyone? Can you wave? [MUSIC] Bye. [MUSIC]
