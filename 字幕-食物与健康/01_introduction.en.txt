[MUSIC] Around the world today, people are
suffering from more diet-related diseases than ever before in recent history. [MUSIC] The so-called Western diet has
been implicated as the major contributor to our modern
epidemics of disease. >> We don't actually know what about the
western diet is creating the problems but what we do know with a great deal of
confidence is that populations who eat this diet which is normally defined as
a diet high in meat high in processed foods with very little whole grains
very little fruits and vegetables.The populations who eat that way have
very high rates of chronic disease. [MUSIC] >> When you think about
the increasing rates of obesity and diabetes you could really think of
it as a tsunami wave off the coast. It's enormous. [SOUND] Physicians nowadays more than
ever need to advise patients about food. Which foods to eat more of or
less of and why. How to shop for, prepare, cook,
enjoy healthy delicious foods. Not just nutritious fats
not bio-chemistry but food. >> We are living in a food environments
that fails to support our health. Taking back the control
over our food preparation is essential to our long term well-being. By examining our eating behaviors and
learning the skills we need to reclaim responsibility for what's in our food,
we can celebrate the foods that will protect us and bring us pleasure for
the rest of our lives. [MUSIC]
