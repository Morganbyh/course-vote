[MUSIC] Hi, I'm Maya. Welcome to my kitchen. Today, I'd love to show you how to
make a very simple ricotta cake. It's the fastest cake you'll ever make. It tastes a little bit like a cheesecake,
and it's full of calcium. It's got some protein in it, so it's a really healthy alternative, when
your children feel like a quick dessert. My sister taught me how to make this so,
thanks, Tania. That's what big sisters are for. And it's really simple,
so let's get started. So what we're going to do is we're
going to crack three eggs into our mixer. >> You spilled. >> I spilled, I know. Better to be real than to be perfect. >> And this. >> It's okay to make a mess
when you're cooking, right? We're going to crack our eggs on a flat
surface so that we try not to get contact between the inside of the egg and
the outside of the egg, if possible. Apparently, eggs can sometimes
have salmonella on the outside, so better to crack them on a flat surface,
I recently learned. Okay, here we go. There we've got our three eggs in there. Now the next thing we're going to
do is add a little bit of sugar. It's quite a low sugar cake
this one because it's only got about a half a cup of sugar in it for
the whole cake. What I'm going to do first is just
blend up the eggs and the sugar. [NOISE] And then. >> We're going to stop that. What's this called? Do you know what this is? Can you say ricotta? >> Ricotta. >> This is ricotta. Ricotta cheese has a lot of calcium in it. It's got protein, and if it's a choice
between a store-bought cake and something like this, this is so
much better for children. And I think it's tastier. It's kind of like a cheesecake. It's got a bit of a lemony taste to it. Delicious, and these guys love it. Okay, we're going to blend the ricotta
in there with the egg and sugar mixture. [SOUND] And now. >> It's yellow. >> Yeah it's yellow you're right. Are you ready to help me add this? >> Yeah. >> Are you ready? Slowly tap it. Tap it. Okay, we just added some
gluten free baking mix. It's just a natural mix of rice flours and
a little bit of a raising agent. We have one child who
can't have any gluten so we make all of our deserts gluten free. So we've blended this up. It's a nice batter now for
the ricotta cake. And all we have to do is add
a little bit of fresh lemon juice. Right? Isn't that exciting to watch? >> Yeah. >> Good. >> [INAUDIBLE] that far away. >> We're going to add this too. These are gluten free
graham cracker crumbs. You can either crush some graham crackers,
or you can buy them as crumbs and we've just greased a kind
of a glass pie dish. This is going to make my crust, that's it. >> I'm going to sprinkle
some of these on the bottom. If you like a thick crust
you can sprinkle more and if you like a thinner crust
you can sprinkle less. I'm just going to use about that much and
then we're going to just nudge it around. Okay, now that is our crust. And all we have to do now, we're going to
pour Our ricotta batter on top of those breadcrumbs, and
it's going to bake into our crust. [SOUND] I make this cake
when I'm in a rush and I need something nice to serve for
tea or for dessert. It's a very healthy option, you can
even put a slice in the lunchbox and the children will feel so treated. [SOUND]
>> What is that? >> That is the fastest cake ever. Now we're going to go put it in the oven. [MUSIC] Okay, so
our ricotta cake has come out of the oven. Ideally you want to let it
cool to room temperature or even chill it in the fridge and
then it'll taste more like a cheesecake. But I have a hungry child down
the stairs who's been waiting for this cake, so I don't think we're
going to be able to wait that long. The way in which we know that it's cooked, is when it starts to get a little
bit golden brown on the outside. So I'm just going to cut into this, even
though it's not quite fully cooled yet. And we'll let it cool on the plate. When the customers are waiting,
you have to deliver. [LAUGH] Okay. And a little piece for me. I'll go call him. [MUSIC] What do you say? Good? >> Two thumbs up. >> Two thumbs up. So there you have it,
we have a happy customer. I'm Maya, thanks for joining me. Hope to see you again soon. [MUSIC]
