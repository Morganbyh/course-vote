You've just completed the third module introducing the derivative and Leibniz notation. This next module continues the development of differential calculus by introducing you to a myriad of techniques and ways of exploiting the first and second derivatives of the function. You'll learn how to recognize when a function is increasing or decreasing by looking at the sign diagram of the first derivative, indicating turning points associated with local and global maxima and minima and how to recognize when a curve is concave up or concave down by looking at the sign diagram of the second derivative, indicating points of inflection. You'll develop a systematic protocol for curve sketching including information gleaned from the sign diagrams for the first and second derivatives, as well as information about x and y intercepts and any asymptotic behavior, which tells us what happens when quantities get very large in magnitude. You'll learn rules for finding derivatives of complicated functions built from simple functions using the Chain Rule, the Product Rule, and the Quotient Rule, and you'll be up to exploit information about the derivative to solve difficult optimization problems. Again, we hope that you find the material interesting and stimulating, that you find the videos helpful and the practice and challenges provided by the many exercises beneficial. I look forward very much to your continued attention and participation.
