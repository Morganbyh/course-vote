Welcome back. You've just completed the first module which set the stage and gave you lots of practice with real numbers and algebra manipulation. Especially in the context of equations, inequalities, approximations in the Theorem of Pythagoras. You also developed fluency with the Cartesian xy-plane, and started to think about the way we can visualize relationships between quantities. This next module is a natural progression, where we formally introduce the notion of a function that unifies the mathematics, by capturing precisely ways in which we link together different quantities or measurements. Functions use precise rules and processes. You'll gain insight and an understanding of their myriad effects and subtleties by graphing them in the xy-plane. Over a succession of videos, we'll develop an extensive repertoire including quadratic, cubic and general power and polynomial functions, exponential and logarithmic functions associated with exponential growth and decay, and trigonometric functions related to the mathematics of periodic behavior. You'll also learn how to create new functions using composition and inversion, and discover tricks for moving backwards and forwards between quantities algebraically, but also visually by thinking about what happens by transformations in the xy-plane. We hope that you'll find the material interesting and stimulating, that you find the videos helpful, and the practice and challenges provided by the many exercises, beneficial. I look forward very much to your continued attention and participation.
